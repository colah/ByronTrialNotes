==============================

(Judge has final draft of ruling on warrant.)

(Judge asks for a supplementary factum on manner of search issues)

(Judge wants Crown & Counsel to work on schedule)

Crown: We're hoping to have some time later this week to start the Crown's case.

Swear in Detective David Ouellett

* Technically with the Toronto Police, but seconded to RCMP
  * I'm with INSET, related to terrorism offenses.
* How did you get involved in this case?
  * During the confusion around the G20/G8 began, we had a strict mandate to investigate national security. 
  * In this case, we were running a parallel investigation and considering making it a national security investigation under the terrorism section of the criminal code.
* Were you part of the police investigation?
  * I filed documents.
* Did you help French write the document?
  * No.
  * Became involved when we heard about explosives.
  * I did a visual inspection for national security of the home in the second warrant.
* There were a bunch of computer seized?
  * After the search, a large number of computers were seized. We initially thought the police would analyze it, but it was turned over to the RCMP, under my direction. I had them searched for evidence.
* You physically brought it to your unit? Where?
  * Yes. To London, Ontario.
* One harddrive?
  * Yes
* You had it searched?
  * I filled out a work order form. I gave key words to facilitate the investigation. 
* Are you a computer expert?
  * No.
* What is your understanding of what happened to the computers.... It was searched by ...?
  * Yes.
* What do they do?
  * They take stuff and put it on screen so that someone like me can see it. Then I go through the list and checkmark...
* What keywords did you give?
  * G20, torrents, everyone involved in the G20, and so on. But I still went over the whole harddrive.
* Was there anything they couldn't access?
  * There was a encrypted vm made by truecrupt. I understand that it was 256 bit encryption. For me, that's big.
* Are they still working on decrypting that portion?
  * Yes.
* Before you went to London, what investigation did you do on your own?
  * I had access to the information on the case. I had a good knowledge of it.
* When did you get access to the information?
  * Not until October.
  * I was there for 3 weeks checkmarking evidence.
* Do you have a list of keywords and phrases?
  * Not before me.
* (It was found
  * We are looking for all videos, pictures... relating to G20
  * Any and all torrents
  * Explosives
  * Anarchist material
  * Anti-government material
  * Toronto community mobilization network.
  * Jokes, blogs or other content of a racist nature
* Some of that isn't directly related. Why?
  * Part of the investigation was conspiracy.
  * National security concerns... we believed that the community mobilization network is associated with black block tactics.
  * Those key words were to locate ideology or drive behind the motive to set out a explosive device. I have training not given to regular police, including pre-terrorism indicators. You look for ideology. For example, Al Quada is based the on ideology of the Qur'an... or their interpretation of it.
  * "Birds of a feather flock together" -- If I could... find others.
  * We have a bigger intelligence division... I tasked them early on to do open source investigation.
* What, in the open source search, caused you concerns like the above?
  * Uploads and downloads of jokes regarding the Prophet Mohammad of a racist nature.
  * Ragner's Guide to Home Explosives.
  * Arachist cookbook.
  * PDF file: setting fires with electrical timers.
* You have these intelligence officers bookmarking the data... And then you read the data. How long did that take?
  * 3 weeks. 
* Did you restrict your search to the data that was bookmarked?
  * No.
* Why?
  * You can't tell the content of a file from its title. If you think of a drug investigation, a drug dealer doesn't keep his drugs in a zip lock bag labeled "cocaine".
* Was there any time of file that you didn't think you had authorization to view?
  * I had a valid warrant to search the computer, and I had reasonable grounds to think that everything was relevant.
* Was there anything that wasn't set out in the warrant but that you thought was relevant?
  * Yes.
  * I found Canadian and US military documents
  * Radio frequency information of police.
  * I found pictures of potato cannons.
  * That's just off the top of my head.
* When you did come across that material, what did you do?
  * I would bookmark it, at the completion of my report, ... the bookmark data went into the report.
* Under what authority?
  * Plain view, if not otherwise identified on the warrant.
* So you add and take away bookmarks, and then they turn it into the report
* The rules when you use the report, you must not be connected to the Internet or use the back button.
  * The Internet may make the software not work.
  * Back button doesn't work reliably
...
  * You may get a popup block warning when you click on links depending on what security settings you have on your computer.
* Judge: This looks like the as disclosed version, and may contain things I shouldn't be seeing.
  * I don't thinks so.
...
  * Exhibit #1 and #20 are the important ones... They are the same thing. One is the computer and one is the harddrive. It is my understanding is that, in addition to being technically proper, the harddrive is its own separate entity that was removed from the computer.
* The entire is the report, but the part that is relevant... The evidence that is relevant to this is exhibit #1
  * Yes. 
* Judge: Is that the whole computer?
  * Crown: I think it is just the relevant content.
    * Witness: Yes.
* Perhaps you could give an example for the computer...
* Judge: Are those dates of access Mr. Sonne's or yours?
  * (Not sure what the judge means.)
* (They look at torrent file) What's that?
  * The path to the document, we couldn't necessarily retrieve it.
* "The back button doesn't compute."
* In the absense of anything in the warrant relating to conspiracy, would you still have searched the entire computer?
  * Yes.
* And would you still have seized everything?
  * Yes.
* On what grounds?
  * Plain view.


Defense Crosses

* Judge: First, we should make this an exhibit. 
  * Registrar: Exhibit 15.
* Judge: What should we call it? 
  * "Detective Oulett's report"
* Defense: I'd like to have the Crossexamination from the preliminary inquiry added to the record to streamline this report.


* It was your view that the search was conducted under the warrant. Is this the warrant that you were referring to?
  * Yes.
* Because you weren't involved in the investigation prior to the first warrant. ...
  * I didn't enter until June 23
* This was the warrant for the search?
  * And the first.
* But there were no subsequent ones.
  * Yes.
* And would you agree that, on its face, it is a warrant to search a residence at Edlderwood drive and has a time limit...
  * Yes.
* And you didn't deliver the computers until June 29th, and the search happened afterwards?
  * Yes.
* In Appendix A there is list of things to search for?
  * Yes.
* You reviewed it before searching?
  * Yes.
* Did any question arise in your mind as to whether this warrant specified the seizure of computers?
  * There was no way to do it in the home.
  * My understanding from Detective Bui was that they were all seized lawfully.
* Did the warrant authorize the seizure?
  * No.
* But even though they were not seized under the warrant, but you could still search them.
  * They were seized under plain view.
* And how did you come to understand that they were seized under plain view?
  * Talking to Detective Bui, I came to understand that they were all seized lawfully.
* Did you talk to ... about it?
  * No.
* Once you got the computers, your interest was searching them, and then seizing data.
* What was your understanding of the phrase "dealers, whether associate or friends".
  * Not the language I would have used. I understood it to mean that people Mr. Sonne had dealing with.
* You had some questions about it?
  * Yes.
* It's not just the words of the affiant, but the words on a court order.
  * Yes.
* You formed that interpretation of dealers on your own? Not in consultation with anyone?
  * No.
* And you didn't seek a clearer court order?
  * No.
* Would you agree that that is a pretty broad interpretation of the warrant?
  * Yes.
* Because anyone that he's had dealings with... would include photos of him with anyone else?
  * Yes.
* "Records relating to the production of explosives" -- How did you interpret that phrase?
  * Quite simply, files relating to production of explosives. 
* If the order had been "Records relating to explosives" would things have been different?
  * No.
* So you saw it as meaning anything related to explosives?
  * Yes.
* And you offered the services of the RCMP to the Toronto Police?
  * No. I didn't have the authority to to do so. But others did. 
* Did it cause you any concern that [one of the searchers] was a civilian?
  * He was a sworn civilian. Sworn an oath of secrecy.
* No concern that he wasn't a peace officer?
  * No.
* That the warrant authorized only peace officers? Did that concern you?
  * No.
* Were you aware that one sometimes files assistance orders to get the aid of a civilian? 
  * Yes.
* But you didn't think that was necessary here?
  * No. Never crossed my mind.
* Records related to ownership and living relationships. Were any of those seized?
  * No.
* Records related to the production of explosive... Would you say that only a few of those were seized?
  * I'd have to count them up and put them into some sort of equation...
* Well, if we go through the torrents.... For example Ragner's guide to home explosives?
  * Yes.
* Now you understand that a torrent file is a link... It doesn't contain the actual text.
  * Yes.
* It's a description of how to find it?
  * Yes.
* [Technical description of bit torrent]
  * That's an explanation Hackers might use. It's used to circumvents copyright.
* Are there any other uses of it? Is it used to distribute enterprise software?
  * Yes. 
* [Starts listing production of explosive related torrents]
* [specific torrent with nuclear in title] Did that relate nuclear power, or?
  * I don't know. Possibly transportation and explosives.
* How is "Assassination Politics" related?
  * It's an ideology file.
* G20 Fence? How is that related to the production of explosives?
  * ...
* ...
* Are there any others?
  * Not that I know of.
* Well, let me help you. You also found some receipts...
  * [He lists receipts of things that are related to the production of explosives]
* Anything else that was seized relating to the production of explosives?
  * Some pictures.
  * I didn't know what they were for, but they could have been related to explosives
* So it was your view that anything electronic related to timing was related to the production of explosives?
  * Yes.
* Alarmclock?
  * Yes.
* Cellphone?
  * Yes.
...
* What items were seized as relating to co-conspirators?
  * Skype, email...
* That was a very broad interpretation?
  * Yes... I have no way of knowing until I looked.
  * I had to look at every video to make sure it was what it said.
* What was your understanding of what conspiracy it was that you were searching for?
  * Pardon?
* Well, conspiracy is an agreement... "any conspiracy related to the above"
  * Yes.
* What was the conspiracy offense that you were looking for?
  * All of the above.
* What was the offense you were investigating?
  * Conversations, ....
* What was the offense you were investigating?
  * All of the above.
  * Conspiracy to set off a bomb in the G20 fence line

(Break)

* Were there any other conspiracies you were investigating?
  * Plans to set off another explosion to distract
  * Plans to disrupt the summit
* Plans to disrupt the summit. What offense would that fall under? 
  * One... Two... Three... Four... and Five. All of them.
* Not trying to link to a specific offense. You were looking at the big picture.
  * No I was linking to the big picture. 
* Charge 1 is intimidation of the justice system as a completed offense...
* Judge: You're using legal terminology and the officer may not understand it.
* Crown: Yes. I was about to object.
* Officer, it was a completed offense. There was a start date and an end date. It was completed in the time friend. 
   * Yes.
* Judge: I'm not sure that consistent to with my findings. The threat could be in the future.
* Officer, I mean a completed threat. The threat can involve a threat to do something in the future. You don't have to follow through with it, because the threat itself can be harmful.
* A completed threat to destroy property. 
* A conspiracy is committed, do you agree, when there is an agreement for an ... unlawful purpose.
  * Yes.
* It doesn't need to be completed.
  * Yes.
* To marry these together, did you understand it to be an agreement to commit that completed offense, or one in the future?
  * Both.
* So you weren't just investigating ...
   * I was investigating the conspiracy within those dates ...
* You knew that Mr. Sonne had been arrested on June 22nd.
  * Yes.
* Regarding count 3, did you understand conspiracy to be within that time frame, or beyond that...
  * Yes.
* Is it fair to say that you though, with the conspiracy, you thought the date limits no longer mattered?
  * Yes.
* There would be visiting heads of state... Are those things you can't get into because of national security concerns.
  * Yes. I can't get into them.
* Is it fair to see that you have an overarching view or concern that you're investigating?
  * Yes.
* There were somewhat interwoven in your mind?
  * They were individual charges, but there was a common theme.
* Would it be fair to say that you saw it as a larger, overarching, broader conspiracy?
  * Yes.
* Would it be fair to say that as a National Security officer you investigate differently than an investigating officer?
  * I'm still an investigating officer. I just have more training and resources.
* But you have a wider view?
  * The scope of my view has been widened by my training.
* Would you agree with me that, in dealing with matters of National Security, you often deal with intelligence.
  * There a misunderstanding between Police Intelligence and Security intelligence
  * police are required to hold an evidentiary standard. CSIS is not.
* ...
  * I can't discuss how CSIS gathers intelligence
* You were acting more in your role as a investigating officer than a national security...
  * Yes.
* Do you recall what you asked them to do when you dropped off the computers?
  * I just dropped them off.
* Did you ask them to do anything.
  * Just, you know, prepare it...
* Did you give the warrant?
  * ...
* There was a request a week later for a copy of the warrant?
  * Yes.
* And you helped them get it?
  * Yes.
* did you have a conversation about what it authorized?
  * No.
* ...
* Email with key words?
  * Yes.
* This issue of the keywords turns up ... "We'd like to know what specifically you are looking for..." So they come to you asking for details?
  * Yes.
* We are looking for...
* Fence or other? That's a broad request. You're looking for all information relating to the G20 summit?
  * Yes.
* All torrents upload as relate to the open source search. You were hoping to connect him to the pirate bay account?
  * Yes.
* Toronto Community Mobilization Network?
* Prior to giving this instruction, is it fair to say there was nothing linking Mr Sonne to the Mobilization Network?
  * Yes.
* It was related to another case you working on?
  * Yes.
* You wanted a list of contacts to crossreference with Anarchists?
* Any Anarchist reading material. Would that fall under ideological evidence?
  * Yes.
* Is it fair to say that you were investigating the possibility that there could be a terrorism charge?
  * Yes.
* ...
* Jokes, blogs ... of a racist nature? More ideological nature?
  * Yes.
* Aware of any evidence that my suggest racial motivation?
  * No. But we had some open source...
* There were some pictures on Flickr that touched upon political subjects?
  * Yes.
* But they were often jokes?
  * Yes.
* Flickr [means twitter] post on Tamil protest... Is it fair to say that that was your racial motive evidence?
  * ... I had no way of knowing, but it was possible.
* But nothing that turns it into something concrete?
  * I had reasonable grounds.
* I'd suggest that you didnt' have reasonable grounds, you just had a suspicion.
  * Absolutely not!
* Was there anything else that you used to form reasonable grounds that there was a racial motive?
  * Not to the best of my knowledge, no.
* Did you have an opportunity to speak further 

* ...
   * Mr. Sonne was clearly someone who was quite computer savy, so the volume of data was quite large.
* Do you know what dates you received these updates?
  * No.
* Didn't ask about how things were going on?
  * I had updates as things were found...
  * There was an update about nuclear sites, because it raised concern.
* To be clear, item #1 was an apple notebook computer?
  * We would describe it as the main computer in the house hold?
* There were five computers?
  * Apple time capsule, router, modem, ...
* You described #1 as the main computer... Would you agree that Ms. Peterson had a second computer?
  * Yes. Though there was a secondary user on the main computer.
* There was a folder "Kristen Movies" that you went through -- just to make sure they weren't something else?
  * Yes.
* Do you remember when you were notified that they had finished their ...
  * It's still not.
* OK, then that phase? Do you remember when they finished?
  * No.
* If I suggested it was in September...
  * I wouldn't know.
* And they had made an image. A perfect copy... And all of that was available to you on a RCMP computer.
  * Yes, at their office.
* It's to insure the integrity of the original is maintained?
  * ... I couldn't comment. I understood...
* You used a piece of software called ncase, to go over the files?
  * Yes.
* And you went over everything?
  * Except the encrypted section.
* Did you understood the bookmark to have been done by an automated search or by ... ?
  * Both.
* I'm going to suggest the bookmarks were your starting point?
  * It was like a cheat sheet on a math exam. Fast, but I still had to go through everything.
* Do you know if those original bookmarks still exist?
  * I wouldn't know.
* You didn't preserve it?
  * I wouldn't know how.
* You deleted some things from their original bookmarks?
  * Things that are completely irrelevant.
* I want to focus on what test was in your mind when you took items that were not covered by the warrant... You did take things that weren't under the warrant?
  * Yes.
* What test did you apply?
  * Was there reasonable grounds that it would afford evidence.
* Was there anything that you thought was relevant but didn't rise to the standard of reasonable grounds?
  * I can't answer that until we decrypt the encrypted portion.
* I'm going to suggest that you bookmarked everything that wasn't clearly irrelevant.
  * No.
* Let's go back a sec, leaving aside the encrypted portion. Were there any items where you thought, that's of interest but didn't rise to the standard of reasonable grounds?
  * No.
* So everything that was of interest you bookmarked?
  * Everything that was of interest and relevant.
* So your test was relevance?
  * No.
* You made no attempt to verify that the internal clock of the computer was accurate?
  * No.
* This is really *your* report?
  * I understand this is kind of confusing. The report is based on my knowledge, but I don't have the technical skills to do it. 
* From your perspective, your doing the investigative report and they're your assistants?
  * Yes.
* If you could bring up the report...
  * I can already tell you that I'm not listed.
* Lee is listed as the investigative officer, isn't he?
  * Yes.
* Letter on harddrive, to you on Nov ...
* Report not complete
  * Related to encryption.
* They offer to give you full harddrive. 
  * That would be how counsel would get it.
* Have I misread it, they're asking you if you'd like a copy?
  * I don't know why, I've already gone over it.
* Your role is described as "screened by you for disclosure purposes":
  * Yes it does.
* It should be noted that only knowledge relevant, or not clearly irrelevant, has been included in this report.... 
* Do you remember reading this?
  * Yes.
* Do you think this accurately describes your role:
  * I didn't pay much attention to the email.


(Lunch)

* Why did it take so long? If you went over it in 3 weeks, why did it take months for them to bookmark some. And why did they do it, anyways, if you were going to go over everything.
  * They had to prepare it. And I had other cases.
* They had to image the harddrive.
  * And import it into ncase
* And how long did that take?
  * I don't know.
* How often in the months before you worked on it were you occupied.
  * I don't know. I'd need my other case books.
* And you don't think that it was unnecessary to have them go it first, even with you planning to look over everything.
  * Certainly not.
* Now the warrant had time limits.
  * Yes.
* But you searched outside that. In fact, as I understand it, you are still searching the computer with regards to the encrypted portion of the harddrive.
  * Yes.
* As you are concerned, is there any time constraint on you searching the computer?
  * No.
* If something came up later and you wanted to look over it, could you?
  * I'd need a warrant. If it was a different charge.
* If it was the same charge, later?
  * I could look over it.
* [Defense points out file that was written to 2 days after arrest] This must be a file that was automatically updated. Certainly, you have no information of a police officer writing to it.
* TwitterPod2.sql converted to TwitterPod2.xls, do you know what the nature of this file is?
  * No.
* Did you review its content?
  * No. I trusted them to convert it.
* Did you look at the sql file?
  * Yes.
* What do you recall it to be?
  * Let's open it and see.
* Before we do that, what do you recall it to be?
  * I recall it to be the consistent with my report. [opens file]
* Spreadsheet of tweets.
  * [Recognizes unix epoch timestamp as time]
  * [another unix timestamp in column not clearly labeled time, says it's ID]
  * [Names; notes that some are real names]
* Do you understand this to be an automated file that recorded all tweets that he made, were sent to him, or of people he was following.
  * I understood it to be a conversation he was part of... Some of it was automated, yes.
* There were several thousand tweets. Did you find any that were of interest and you didn't already have?
  * Our interest was in connecting the identity
* Files relating to radio waves? Those were of interest to you?
  * Since the warrant mentioned a device that could knock out radio communications.
* Twitter links to goat master pirate bay account.
* As you were reviewing the emails, do you recall a series of emails between Mr. Sonne and Mr. Spragett. 
  * I don't recall.
* Do you recall emails about them putting together a presentation on radio countersurveilance.
  * Yes.
* Do you recall if you put it in?
  * I don't remember.
* Email with Kate Milberry -- two email accounts associated with her one from UofT and one from gmail. Also an email from Andrew Clement, discussing surveilance group, setting up a Flickr page for documenting the G20 countersurveilance measures. ... Why did you seize this?
  * There was an email relating to a club and we were investigating a conspiracy, and they could potentially be involved.
* Did you have reasonable grounds to beleive that they were involved in a conspiracy to commit a criminal act with Mr. Sonne?
  * ... They could potentially... 

* "G20/G8 monitoring & documenting" to hacklab discussion. Why did you seize this?
  * Because he was talking to a group called "hacklab" about the G8/G20 about documenting.. related to intimidating a justice system participant.
* They might be people Mr. Sonne was conspiring with, but you didn't have reasonable and probable grounds.
  * ...
* Do you agree that ">" show quotes?
  * My understanding is that he wrote that. Because it says, on [date] Mr. Sonne wrote...
* I'm suggesting that the ">" means that that part was a quote.
  * That would be a question for Mr. Sonne, not me.
* Judge: There's some sections where the person writing switches but no ">", what am I to take from that.
  * Defense: But there is a line instead.
* Why did you seize this email?
  * It was part of a discussion group that would be a group that Mr. Sonne was part of.
* In your opinion, that brought it within the four corners of the warrant? 
  * Yes.
* Could you read the "one amusing thing I've done" paragraph?
  * You're skipping four paragraphs.
* Yes, I'm trying to draw your attention to a specific paragraph.
* Why did you seize it?
  * It relates to him having torrents, which relate to other concerns.
  * That was my reasonable grounds.
* There's an explanation in the email
* "On the other hand, I've bought several pieces of laboratory equipment and chemical precursors in an attempt to purposefully raise flags and get 'the man' to take a look at me... but no luck" Was that of significance to you?
  * The fact that he admits he was buying precursors was. 
* I'd like return to the issue of Cpl. Lee and Mr. Letch's involvement in the investigation. Do you agree that they were initially in charge?
  * No.
* Did they give you ...
* You knew that there was a bail review for Mr. Sonne in this courthouse is September?
  * Yes.
* And you made no effort to get an update on the contents of the computer?
  * I got some updates on the size and ...
* One final question, and you may explain as you like: Is it the case, Officer, that you got a set of preliminary results, and that they weren't the results you were hoping for, so you decided go in yourself?
  * Absolutely not. It is our practice in all cases to have the 


Prosecution:
*  You were asked about legitimate uses of torrents?
  * Yes.
* All Mr. Sonne's torrents were from a site called Pirate Bay?
  * Yes.
* Do you know if that site is still up?
  * No, I don't bevel it is.
* You were asked about the Toronto Community Mobilization Network...
  * ...
* Were your concerns about explosives related soley to the G20 or were there others?
  * I had the concerns that anyone investigating terrorism in the GTA has.
* When did you notice your name wasn't on the report?
  * When I opened it.
* And did you attempt to change it?
  * No, I couldn't. And it didn't change the work that I'd done.
* The encrypted portion, is it sitting on a shelf waiting for someone to work on it?
  * 
* At what point did you decide, that depite that fact you didn't have all the data, that you would make your report.
  * At some point, disclosure had to be preformed. 

* Oullett: Should my computer stay here for the next witness?  All of our computers have password encryption much greater than the one Mr. Sonne uses.


Swear in Jeff Letch

* You are a civilian member of the RCMP?
  * Yes.
* When did you start?
  * 1998
* What does that mean?
* How does that happen?
  * You swear to uphold the laws.
* You've had some discrete inquiries in the last few weeks?
  * Some clarification perhaps
* How did you get involved?

(Crown is fine with leading)

* You received evidence at the end of June 26
  * Yes
* You made image copies of objects.
  * Yes
* Is that one of your routine steps?
  *  Not one of mine. There's a specific person dedicated to that.
* When was that done?
  * I'd have to refer to my notes

(Crown is fine with him referring to his notes)

* Were you able to determine when they were imaged?
  * Early July for the ones I was 
* Are they made available to others when they were imaged?
  * They're put on a project server and shared with others involved.
* Who were you directed by? 
  * Initially David Oullet.
* Did you start reviewing the items of interest?
* You got a list of keywords.
  * I just went through the file structure and looking at what was there.
* Did you look inside them all?
  * When it warranted it. Some are easily recognizable as expected files, naturally occurring in the operating system, or distinguishable by file type, size...
  * Looked at files that seemed relevant for the warrant, tagged them.
* You got a 4074 form with related information?
  * Yes.
* What did you consider the significance of the warrant as regards your work?
  * Try to understand the wording, what was intended.
* What did you think of the word dealers?
  * It could mean a lot of things
* Did you come up with specific interpretation?
  * No.
* Did you ask for clarification?
  * Lee did.
* Time constraints on the search?
  * I saw it, but we weren't involved in the search in any way. 
* Search for terms and get hits. was there another step 
* ...
* Were the initial set of bookmarks preserved?
  * It should be in the case file.
* Even if Officer Oulette came in later, and changed things?
  * It's possible. We're just analysts.


Prosecution:

* Does something having a jpeg extension necessarily mean that it is a jpeg?
  * No.

Defense:

* Can your software detect files with wrong extensions. 
  * Yes.
* Without looking at the file?
  * yes.


Swear in Cpl. Lee
