Byron Trial, Day 22 (Week 6)
============================

**Summary:** Ouellett testifies again, introducing the content of Byron's computers as evidence for the trial proper. Ouellett's lack of expertise on computers becomes problematic.

********

* New court clerk on the job, is being very strict about the rules today. Temporarily not allowed to use laptop...
* Allowed to use laptop

* Ruling on 10(a/8?)
* Ruling on production orders
* Ruling on the admissibility of the statements.
* Have electronic copy of agreed statement. 
* Confirm that Mr. DiLuca sent an email about missing today.

* Peter: Mr Tilly is back to finish the trial.

* Prosecution: we've spoken... Balance of the evidence. Will have Detective ... this morning, then Ouellett and Lee. Don't expect that to take more than a day -- I don't believe its that contentious. I don't believe any of the evidence in the next 2 or 3 days be is that controversial, besides questions of relevance and admissibility. There may be a voir dire. Evidence for the voir dire is on a thumb drive.

* Judge: Consider it as it comes into evidence, as long as counsel doesn't want me to decide in advance... By the way, I didnt' forget about the global 24(2) analysis, it just isn't done. I'm working on it.

* Prosecution: ... The hard drive with the evidence has stopped working... It may work as soon as he gets up there, or it may not.

* Judge: we'll stand down for a few minutes.

* (Everyone is joking about whether Byron should be asked to fix it.)

* Torrents on the hard-drive. The crown will be tendering some of these... Evidence that Mr. Sonne uploaded torrents with these names. No one from the police downloaded them, but we would suggest, for example, that this (motions) is a book "Ragner's guide to home explosives" and has the same title. We can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it is the same, but we'd argue that there is a strong inference. 

* Judge: Where did you get it?

* Prosecution: The police sourced it.

* Judge: But we don't know that it has the same content?

* Prosecution: No, to download it would technically be copyright infringement...

* Judge: So we have a list of the names of torrents uploaded... And items matching their description.

* Defense: My friend gave a long preamble... This was going to be an agreed statement of fact rather than on the record. I can indicate that the torrent is a pointer... These documents reflect real documents in the real world, some version of them, substantially.

* Ouellett sworn in.

* INSET, Integrated National Security Enforcement Team; You're specifically there for anti-terrorism...
  * Yes
* You're mainly involved because of technology material.
  * Yes.
* You're familiar with torrents? Ragner's guide to home and recreational use of explosives... With respect to the setting fires, who was responsible for that?
 * A group in the US, the Earth Liberation Front, sometimes called an anarchist terrorist group that now has factions world wide.
* Assassination Politics?
 * Written by an MIT graduate, Jim Bell, which describes a system of pseudo-assassination of high ranking government officials where money is put in a bank account to create an incentive to kill them. Bell was eventually brought into custody for intimidation of government officials; he's coming of for parole this year.
* Security culture, a hand book for activists.
 * A manual on counter-intelligence... How to not discuss or discuss on tact... It's a training manual for activists that want to lash out at government.
* Did you ever come across it?
 * Only paths, we were never able to download it ourselves.

Photos
------

* Let's move onto the data taken from the computer. You went through the different areas... Can you first go to the photo area?
  * photos/62 (a picture of a camera)
    * (Except the numbers are shifted up one here. Your Honor will not be working with those later.)
  * RCMP file number, 20 is exhibit number, where it came from (path, user), when the file was created, last written to, and last accessed.
  * Why is the last accessed date not today?
     * Because it is not the original hard drive and we can't write to it
       * (It is a report viewed in a (really horrible) website. It seems very likely that the date was written into the report and doesn't get updated for that reason....)
  * 20th of June, 2010.
  * Large number of additional cameras put in place before the summit...
  * (Lots of other pictures of cameras, fence line)
  * Skip some photos
  * fence line, camera, 
  * All written at the same date?
    * My understanding is the file created date is the date it was uploaded to the computer.
  * Then photos from the 18th. Photos believed to be a way to scale the fence.
  * Picture of University Avenue.
    * They went to the site and noticed that several cameras were in the area the camera to a picture of.
    * Hilton hotel is visible and important people would have been there.
    * Synonymous with trade craft for counter-surveillance
      * Judge: what do you mean?
      * If there was an attack on University, one would do this sort of counter-surveillance before hand. We give this sort of training to officers.
      * Defense clarifies nature of evidence.
    * Officer, you referred to security culture. Can you clarify what you meant?
      * Defense rise.
      * We aren't asking fo expert testimony...
      * Defense: If this is going to be expert testimony I need a report before hand.
      * Prosecution laughs. This isn't expert testimony, I'm just getting him to clarify.
      * Witness: Clarifying, and sorry for using jargon, by security culture I mean the sort of thing one does with the CIA or CSIS. It also includes groups that are not involved in non-governmental counter intelligence.
      * Prosecution: Was that term in one of the handbooks?
      * Yes, there was a handbook for activists doing counter intelligence in preparation for an attack.
  * (Judge starts using a recording device so that she can listen too later)
  * More camera photos.
  * Picture of Hilton hotel, picture of American embassy in distance.
  * Judge: Is there any disagreement about the times. Doesn't one have information about the times in the photo?
  * Defense: Normally there would be meta-data, but I believe it was stripped in this case.
  * Defense: The witness is not really an expert, not familiar with the difference between the created and last written dates?
  * Prosecution: Was the American embassy near the fence line?
    * Witness laughs. There's always a fence around the American embassy during events.
  * The fence around the convention where was it?
    * I believe the North part went to north of the embassy.
  * Again, how far north did the fence go? The embassy is across the road from this court house?
  * (break)
  * Believes to be front of convention center.
  * Doesn't recognize photo.
  * (skips over some files)
  * March first 2010, release by US. Customs. Partial seizure. 
  * (skips over some files)
  * Air rifles
   * Do you recognize where it is?
   * In Mr. Sonne's residence. (All that is visible is a wall that's a beige color).
  * (skips over some files)
  * What are those?
    * Graphite rods
    * Why do you believe that?
    * The color.
  * Distillation process of some sort.
  * "water solvent", potassium chlorate crystals
    * Judge, so it's *chloride* crystals?
      * Yes.
  * Distillation process gain, cables going to something.
  * Plastic bucket with cables attached. Would be part of a distillation process or electrolysis process to tear stuff apart.
  * Same lid, but now connected to a home depot bucket. That's part and parcel of how the break down would take place. -- I'm not a chemist by any means, I'm testifying from grade 11 chemistry.
  * (Funnel into plastic bottle) Full chemistry set, if you will.
  * Press, appears to be a manual press of some sort.
  * Electric-hydrolic jack.
  * Schematic that teams to involve the hydrolic jack lifting or pushing.
  * Picture of chapter from chemistry book on Amonium nitrate, which is used in the making of ANFO.
  * in the agreed statement of fact. pictures on Twitter.
    * ...
    * board with holes in it
  * Defense: all of this is already in exhibits. We will prepare a PDF with specifically the relevant things. Why make this an exhibit?

Harddrive status
-----------------

* Is the harddrive on record for the trial? 
 * Judge: It was a blended void dire...
 * ...
 * Judge: I completely understand that it is a privacy issue. 
 * Replacing it...
 * Thumb drive.
 * ...
 * Blended because we weren't going to call things twice, not necessarily wanting to have everything on the record for the rial proper.
 * Remark as letter exhibits?

Calendar Entries
----------------

* Next area, calendar entries. What were those?
 * Entries in what ever email program Mr. Sonne was using. Like we use Microsoft Outlook.
 * TO Community Mobilize. 
   * A group at the organization level of the black block activists, being involved with the police car burning and ...
   * Defense: This witness is giving his view of a large volume that came out after a lengthy litigation. We do not accept it. It's investigative hearsay. And has not been linked to Mr. Sonne.
   * Judge: (Relevance remains to be discussed)
   * Judge: I understand the concern of an officer giving his evidence based on another investigation that he may or may not have been involved in. He suggested it was public knowledge, but I don't know that I can take judicial notice of this.
   * Emails between Mr. Sonne and ... who plead guilty.
   * Judge: Having public record of two women who have pleaded guilty...
   * Prosecution: With respect, the relevance doesn't come up until I've introduced this evidence.
   * Judge: But on the present point.
   * Prosecution: There are emails!
   * Judge: Are you suggesting that the officer can speak to that?
   * ...
   * Judge: I can't accept the nature of the group off this.
   * Judge: The officer isn't in a position to testify to the nature of this group...
   * Prosecution: We should ask the officer.
     * Yes. I am.
   * On what basis?
     * I was on the .. comitee. Frequently briefed on groups of security concern.
   * Were you personally part of the investigation?
     * No.
   * Moving along, would this entry have been autogenerated or made by the user?
     * My understanding based on what I read on the screen is that it was made by Mr. Sonne.
   * Any evidence that he actually went?
     * No.
   * (made exhibit)
   * Rectangular Waveguide Dot PDF
     * You testified earlier that you read or skimmed every article.
       * Yes, part of the investigation was a wave cannon, a machine related to disrupting telecommunication devices.
   * Circular Waveguide Dot PDF
   * (more waveguide documents)
   * Ontario Frequencies Text (.txt)
     * Radio frequencies for police, ambulance...
     * Judge: Is there any objection to his competency to comment on them?
     * Defense: He's probably worked with radio frequencies in policing, but I think it would be easier if we interpreted he is entering the documents rather than interpreting unless the Crown suggests he can provide special information from his expertise...
     * Judge: If I look at the list, I can't tell what it is... I see a list of locations, government agencies and numbers. 
     * There's a title "Ontario Frequencies"
     * Witness: I recognize the numbers as radio frequencies.
     * Defense: He recognizes it, he's not acting as an expert.
   * Defense: My position is that... if there's no objection from the Crown, if she wishes evidence from them besides them besides the documents being entered.
   * Prosecution: He's read everything... He can summarize
   * Judge: I don't think that was the objection... If the officer is giving evidence beyond what I could gather beyond reading the document myself, that is different. I think it reasonable that you identify what Mr. Copeland has called specialized knowledge.

**(Leigh is taking notes for a bit -- I have not yet got them from her but will insert them here when I do)**




Goat as an Acronym
-----------------

* Pictures of goats
* You are of course familiar with Mr. Sonne's goat nickname. You said something about it in previous testimony.
* Defense: What is the relevance?
* "This is a circumstantial case. Mr. Sonne has chosen an online moniker that has, in one form or another, something to do with a goat."
* Judge: "It's a word, it's an English word for an animal. Where would his knowledge about the word goat as an acronym."
* Witness: "Knowledge before this case, coming from hockey jerseys... and it's common use as a term. It's still used by the Pickering hockey team."
* Defense: If that's the only relevance than the Crown can provide... but I'm in your honor's hands. 
* Judge: It seems like something one would need an expert for, much like commenting a tattoo.
* Prosecution: What if I asked him if he googled it? That's becoming a more widely accepted source of information.
* Judge: I don't know that there's any legal prejudice in asking this.
* Defense: The issue is that it is purely speculation.
* Judge: It was in the preliminary inquiry, so there doesn't seem to be harm in hearing it again. I'm not accepting it.
* Judge: So, I'll permit it.
* (Witness is smiling?)
* Witness: Goat is an acronym for "greatest of all time", particularly in hockey. The acronym goat is a self-prophecy.
* Prosecution: It's an ego thing.
* Witness: Yet.

XML (News Feeds)
---------------

* Let's move to the XML section.
* I'm going to put you on the spot. What does XML mean?
 * I don't know.
* A public subscription. It flashes back. It would have been a hyperlink to a file.
* Defense: This might be better if we get it from the technical witness later.
* Prosecution: We have a version where the parts that are in English for us have been highlighted.
* Witness: I didn't have a chance to finish my train of thought because of the objection, but I believe this to be a feed. It pushes things back to the computer. In this case from the Toronto Sun.
  * Stores closing for G20
  * Bomb is actually gardening incident
    * Witness: I have personal experience in this.
  * "Summits have become anachronism" -- witness reads "summits have anarchisms"
  * (Witness complains about how hard it is to read)
  * Google news: Fake lack to cost...
  * Road closures.
  * Police seize hundreds of bullets.
* Prosecution: Would this have needed one to select G20 related things to get this?
* Defense: This is technical.
* Judge: I agree.
* Prosecution: What I'm asking is if you have filtered what you found, are we seeing these because you searched for G20 related things?
 * Yes.
* Anarchists trying to distance from firebombing (old).
* Of the news feeds on the computer, these are the only G20/G8 ones you found?
 * Or anarchist ones.

SQL File (Twitter)
------------------

* Prosecution: About SQL. It's an Excell program. For twitter...
* (Opens twitter log in Excell)
* It's the SQL...
* (Thinks that a certain column is the time, but isn't sure)
* Prosecution: Tweets about a bomb in a persons underwear. Dr. Anderson talked about this and said it was potassium permanganate.
* Judge: 
* Prosecution: I don't know much about twitter, though I now know more than I ever wanted to.
* Witness says that column with URLs are origin of tweets.
* Mr. Sonne tried to get Potassium Permanganate, two weeks after underwear bomber. There was a tweet that Mr. Sonne followed about this. If you follow a tweet, you can be at your computer or at the grocery store and it will end up there.
* Judge: I don't know how they end up on his computer. Is that something you can go into the computer and recover?
* That's what they've done. And then it was translated into an Excell program for your viewing. 
* His tag is in the tweets.
* Judge: By that you mean?
* Goat, or hacklab, or whatever.
* What I find disturbing about Excell is that you can move the columns or change their size to view the text.
* Judge: So, when I'm looking at the SKL data, I need to keep this in mind.
* I've isolated two sections.
* (We have a short lesson on how to use Excell for the Judge...)
 

* "Returned just ahead of the snow and apparently failed bomb attempts..." (tweet; not clear that this was sent by Byron) 
* "I hate how the TSA is inconveniencing us for no reason, other than too look like they're doing something"
  * Who is the TSA?
  * They're essentially the people that govern air flight.
* Neither of those were tweeted by Mr. Sonne.
* "Admits the TSA bashing, took two kids through..." -- again not from Mr. Sonne, but part of the chain of tweets around the underwear bomber and related issues.
* "Questioning authority is a warning sign of terrorism #tsaslogins"
  * It appears that a bunch of users decided to make a mocker of the TSA
* Judge: was that by Mr. Sonne?
  * No. None of these are. They are part of his tweet group or people he was following.
* "TSA: nothing says love like our hands in your underwear" -- referring to the underwear bomber and searches that happened afterwards.
* Tweets 24973-25240
* Judge: And the second section? Let's put it on the record right now.
* tweets 46601-47804
* Prosecution: This data was taken from Mr. Sonne's hard drive and not online.
* Converted into an Excell spread sheet so that we can present it in court.
* Prosecution: This has everything in context, by adding all the tweets. Any others in the conversation will be there.
* ... 
* Judge: section 2 contains Mr. Sonne....
* Defense: very live issues regarding whether this provides full context.
* Judge: You should help the crown get full context.
* Defense: We need to hear the testimony of an expert witness on the content of these files and whether they contain everything that is relevant.
* Defense: I anticipate the evidence will be, people can't follow a hashtag, they can follow an individual or search for a hashtag... Those will not all be on this computer, and it may be impossible to reconstruct at time.
* Judge: Would that make it inadmissible?
* Defense: Mr. Sonne's tweets are already in the record. But the others being provided may not be a full record and their relevance...
* Prosecution: I'm a bit concerned as the Crown is put the evidence that was found by this police as a complete picture. I have mountains less evidence than my friend. I'm here to say this was on Mr. Sonne's computer. I'm trying to put in two sections instead of 46000 lines. There's no disagreement about putting questions to the expert, both the question and the answer will go over my head! I'm not trying to obstruct or... This is getting repetitive and is offensive to the Crown.
* Judge: Mr. Copeland, if not all of the evidence still exists, I don't think that tosses everything out.
* Judge: I don't understand this yet, or how this SKU file was created. We need to hear the evidence. Your position is that none of this was...
* Defense: It's an electronic document, it appears to be computer generated, and just saying "here's some information, draw inferences" is dangerous.
* Judge: I agree that it is important to understand, and we're going to hear it tomorrow... 
* Defense: The issue isn't how many lines go in, but understanding how they were made, what they are, and the completeness of the record around them. ... These are issues that an expert might shed light on.
* Judge: ... The first one has question of relevance and the second of missing context.
* Defense: I haven't been given disclosure.
