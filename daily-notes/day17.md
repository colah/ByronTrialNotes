==============================

(Start, but transcription equipment isn't working. Recess.)

(They decide to reinstall the driver. Must find CD.)

(Issue fixed? Rebooting... )

*Judge: Confirms that she is available to restart the trial the week of march 19th.
*Given that I haven't rules yet of seveability, do we need to provide for further submissions on the question of admissibility of evidence under the bad parts of the warrant?
*Crown: On the computers we're into 24-2 anyways so I don't think it matters very much.
*Defence: Because of the compounding 
*J: Well that's the question, are there any other submissions regarding what evidence was seized only under the bad parts of the warrant.
*D: Ouellette said everything was intertwinned with the conspiracy charge so I don't think it practical or even possible to tease out which parts weren't tainted by the bad parts.
*C: Ouellette made it very clear that he would have searched everything in the same way were the conspiricy charge. not there.
*J: Ok. I think we're ready to start. 

*Defense: Section 9, 10-a, and 10-b breaches are conceded with regards to the june 15 stop. 
*All three officers involved gave evidence that there was no detention, so the officers clearly have no reasonable cause for teh detention (leaving aside 10-a, 10-b and sec. 8).
*J: One difference from Cote I'm going to have to consider is that there has been a remedy already, there is no domino effect, well... 
*D: Assuming the case had been handled differently, and we were starting with a global 24-2 I would still be making the same argument, that looked at globally the evidence should all be thrown out, 
*The unfolding of the narrative starts with this roadside stop, certainly from the side of the TPS.
*J: That's true...
*D: And the surveillance flows directly from the stop.
*In Grant they have a legitimate starting point to the investigation, a roadside stop that is perfectly legal.
*J: It's clear from French that the intelligence bulletins 
*D: Pg 4 of ITO is where ms Knight first appears.
*J: I do recall that he was tasked to prepare the ITO when he received the bulletins.
*D: It's unclear how the two come together but it is clear that the surveillance flows from the stop.
*In Grant they say that discoverablility may have a role on a 24-2 in a case where the discoverablility in clear, but that when it is not clear then discoverability falls away, it is not relevant.
*The best that can be said is that there may have been two investigations that came together into French's ITO, but we can't say what would have been happened were it not for the stop.
*We can't even say with certainty what TPS would have done with an intelligence bulletin, we have no evidence on that. 
*J: I don't beleive there's any evidence as to how and why he got the evidence...
*D: On the face of the ITO there is at least an interweaving, the Knight report is not central 
*Looking back to the stop, you might say that it's not the worst stop, but I would say that the sec, 8, 9, 10-a and 10-b breaches are significantly more serious than the breaches in Grant, and in Grant it was ruled that the exclution was a close call.
*The activity Sonne was engaged in was simply taking photos/videos of the fence. A very much legal activity.
*J: In the context of the G20 it was reasonable to be proactive and talking from him
*D: The ruse gets broken out because Byron tried to exersise his rights. The stop escallates because of *Sonne's resorting to his constitutional rights, it's not because they are gaining ground on him. I beleive in Grant he says he has a fire arm.
*Resorting to your rights cannot result in grounds to arrest. If it gets to a suspention of his rights.
*It's obvious that this was a deliberate attempt. The officers attmitted they had no grounds for a detention. 
*It was intended as a circumvention of a charter right.
*In Grant the officers were relying on statutory authority, the at the time narcotcs control act, to search without a warrant.
*The court found that the narcotics control act was uncontitutional but that the the officers were acting in good faith 
*J: I don't think we have evidence on the legality of the ruse. I don't think there's any evidence that the officers thought that they were doing anything rong.
*D: I don't think there's any law that says that officers have to be honest, but under these circumstances the officers are using a ruse and a threat to arrest to deliberately circumvent his rights. 
*J: Was there evidence to teh effect that the officers were aware that it was illegal?
*D: You cannot in good faith threaten to arrest someone for an offense you know they have not committed.
*It's not a mistake, it's clear that they are going in there with the goal of getting his identity and they do.
*It's not only inapropriate, it's also deliberate.
*This is a sigifiacant and more severe breach than in Grant(2009), and that was a close call. This is not a close call. 
*It's the kind of conduct that the courts should be careful to distance themselves.
*And it certainly infects what follows.
*There may be a tendency to compartmentallised into neat charter violations.
*In Grant there are two lead officers who perpetrating a series of charter violations
*It is at least as disturbing if a random sampling of individuals are perpetrating a series of charter ions
*It is  a different but no less troubling situation here of a general disregard for the charter rights among the force at large
*Re: intel officers: hint that they beleive that the charter is a gateway to court admissibility, not something that needs to be complied with regardless
*As soon as he is detained charter his rights apply
*He was denied this right for hours, while they talked to him in breach of his rights
*It shows an indifference as to whether this person has seen a lawyer, with no justification other than that it's standard operating procedure,
*They are not taking his constitutional rights seriously
*J: It appears that the order was given for a legitimate reason and then no one bothers to recind it but there is no plan.
*D: There is no plan, but an institutional indifference to his rights leaves us with a very similar result.
*It becomes too convienent an answer to use confusion as an excuse, it just so happens that he doesn't get his right to a lawyer, it just so happens that hill and garo come in, it just so happens that they walk out and tell the investigators about it...
*It is our onus, but I think you can make inferences and say that there is no valid explanation for these results. It's recognised that it's very hard for the defence to prove for example racial profiling.
*J: You're asking me to look at everything and throw it all out on the basis of this collection of breaches and you're going to have to meet a very high standard. 
*J: There are inferences you are asking me to draw but you could have called witnesses to help illuminate the question.
*D: There is obviously some kind of a plan, someone is calling the shots. Hill and Garro didn't just walk in.
*J: But even if there is a plan is there evidence of nefariousness?
*D: Confusion can't count for 12 hours without a right to councel. If it is then that's shockingly gross negligence.  
*J: There is a lack of evidence crossing the line from confusion or negigence to a nefarious plan.
*Who suffers from the lack of evidence? If I can't determine that it's a deliberate and nefarious
*D: The denial of the right to councel creates an oportunity for hill and garro.
*This is not a hapenstance takedown, it's managed, there is surveillance, there is a warrant, They chose the time for the warrant, they chose the time for the arrest. It raises the question that is there really that much confusion or is confusion just a convinence dispute.
*J: You're saying that there are inferences that can be drawn and then the burden can be shifted to the crown to try and dispel
*D: Or just to offer a explanation.
*J: You could have called other witnesses, like you did with Lee and Letch, 
*D: And we could have run a public inquiry. At the end of the day you have a guy here who was sitting in a room 
*Eg. On the subject of D. Johnstone, we had no disclosure of his involvement before the voir dire and since then all we have gotten is two emails and they don't have anything to do with sending in hill and garro.
I'm not sure that I need to establish some unified plot in order to get the evidence excluded, and in Cote that's what happened, but in Grant and in *other case* that is not the case.
*Grant (1993) simply stands for the the idea that even if evidence is aquired under a valid warrant it can still be obtained in a manner that is in violation of rights.
*Those breaches can be contextually related, causaully or temporally to the search
*It's clear, using the Grant analysis, that the evidence was obtained in a manner that breached his rights and should fall under a 24-2 analisys.
*It's not just a matter of adding up the breaches, and there's a huge number of them.
*If your honour finds that there has been a pattern of breaches whether through a deliberate plan or though general indifference.
*There is obviously a huge impact on almost all of Mr, Sonne's charter protected rights short if bodily integrity.
*Let me add taht your honour will have to consider the testimony of officer french.
*You honour has made some findings already. The veracity of the witnesses that come before the court, but it has troubling implicaions for the integrity of the system.  
*It' s almost a continuation of the breach that you might come to court and lie about it.
*J: There wasn't any frontal attack on the intergrity of the witnesses before the court. 
*D: Cote was a murder case, that was a very serious case, this is also a serious case 
*If your honour throws everything out there will still be a trial on the councelling count.
*These are cases that test the system, even though the seriousness is there it does not say that it should go to court, set against the political backdrop as it is, this might be a case where we say that it enhances the appearance of the integrity of the justice system if we exclude the evidence and distance ourselves from the actions of the police.

Crown:
The crown's position is not that Hill and Garro did anything wrong, it's simply that it should not have gone into the warrant. 
*Vonlountariness is not an issue because they did not take a statement, and none of their interests are engaged
*If you accept the crowns position on the nature of the encounter then volountariness isn't an issue.
*J: As I see it there wasn't really an onus on the crown to prove the volountariaintess unless you presume the tainting of the subsequent satements?
*C: That's right. 
*J: Although it would obviously assist the crown if you could prove the volountariness of hill and garro.
*C: With respect to Cote, it doesn't represent new law, it is a product of it's own facts
*"A serious and systematic diregard," "not isolated incidents" "disturbing and aberrant police o her behavior" "police deliberately acted abusively"
*From the moment they arrived at Ms Cote's residence there is a deliberate and sustained campaign to deny her access to her rights. 
*Even if you agree with my friends on every count of a breach that still doesn't get you into the ball park of Cote
*J: What of the defence's argument that even if it's negligence there is still a systemic disregard for his charter rights?
*C: To the extent that the factual basis being advanced is that of negligence, or gross negligence, the negligence would have to be of the same magnitude as the 
*In Cote at every turn either there is a breach or something that can be directly related to a breach. 
*The Grant '93 test can be applied here, but if you accept that the evidence is admissible under the grant test then I don't think the defence gets a second kick at the can under an umbrella argument.
*In this case, with respect to the general approach to assessing the impact of the breach. 
*This is not a question of counting up the breaches, what it is is an assessment of the real facts on the ground at the time.
*My friend's submission is that this is a shocking and egregious breach.
*It's clear that there was a detention
*The purpose of this was to find out Mr Sonne's name period
*The motivation is- What changes, what causes the police to add more pressure id Mr. Sonne's mention of the terrorism act
*It's easy for us to look back and say "He uses the word terrorism, does everyone have to lose their heads over this"
*The officer on the street doesn't have the luxury of hindsight, he has a duty to protect the public 
*It's easy for us to say that Mr Sonne is no terrorist
*When one looks at that the so called seriousness of the breach takes on a different complexion
*There are circumstances in which charter rights become secondary, for example exigent cirtcumstances where officers  can search without a warrant and it's not a breach
*I'm not arguing that that is the case here, there was clearly a breach
*What they did is understandable, not nearly as egregious as my friend says not egregious at all 
*When one looks at the limited scope of the intrustion in light of the reasonable concern of the officer in those circumstances
*Would the inclusion of this evidence bring the administration of justice into disrepute?
*I'm not saying that Mr Sonne rights are not important, but to suggest that what offiecr wong did is comprable to teh least of the police acts in Cote.
*There is an issue that is still up in the air, there is a question as to whether there was a 
*If June 15 is a problem we have to look at the degree to which it was the impetus for everything that comes after
*It is the job of the defence to 
*J: I think it is a fair argument to say that we don't know that if Mr French hadn't put the two together... I don't know if you are advancing the discoverablility, but I don't know whether either way whether it would have happened the same way or not.
*C: I think the defence has to establish that certain steps wouldn't have happened before we have to get into discoverability.
*J: So you aren't advancing any evidence that the investigation would have happened anyways because of the internet activities.
*C: No, but I think it's up to the defence to establish the tainting first
*J: You're saying that I have to
*J: If I sever then the warrant stands and there is no section 8 violation subject to an argument re manner of search pursuant to the bad parts.
*C: Quite apart from severability, if the only issue was june 15 there would still be room for a 24-2 analysis
*C: Any gap as to who was in charge, I agree that inferences can be drawn up to an evidentiary standard then the court can act on that, but I submit that the standard has to be met and that it s not here
*There may be cases where it is difficult for the defence to prove something, but that doesn't allow you to draw inferences without drawing evidence.
*The big thing to keep in mind here is that the onus is on the defence to convince you to that the evidence should be excluded
*With respect to Grant, there is nothing aboyt the police conduct here that gives you the impression that the effect is anything other than 
*I'm not downplaying any charter breaches, but this is a human process and police officers are human, these things are going to happen
*If you make the findings that my friends are arguing I agree that that is too many charter breaches
*With respect to Sonne's charter protected interests, some of these are pretty minor eg: computers being searched outside of timeframe
*This is a serious case, there are serious interests and if you concede to my friends cote argument then it certainly guts the crown's case
*To the extent that, not withstanding the fact that the warrant stands, the breaches were part of the proccess that lead to the warrant in the first place, that attracts the 24-2 analysis if the defence would so chose.
*J: I think I should go through and evaluate each count with my blinders on, not considering the global context, and then take them off and look at the big picture seperately?

Defence:
*Grant: there does not need to be a causal relationship between the charter breach and teh discovery of evidence, there can be a temporal and/or tactical connection
*Which can lead to the conclusion that the evidence was obtained in a manner that was in breach of the charter
*Burligham 1995, par 98: (supreme court) relevant to the question of seriousness of circumstances: since the accused is not generally in a position to demonstrate bad faith, they need only point to behavior that might lead to bad faith until the onus shifts to the crown to demonstrate good faith
*Barlow 1994, ...In 24-2 the true burden tends to shift to the crown since the crown is in position to know about police tactics, good faith etc and that it is the crown who is responsible for the appearance if the administration of justice.
*It is not a clear cut case of applicants submission -> applicants burden
*J: Was the crown in a position to know that there was a hole that they would need to fill in that respect?
*D: Well, they knew that there were 12 hours they were going to need to explain. 
*J: You're saying they should have anticipated your areguments? The Cote argument?
*D: Cote is in the factum, it's been there since day one. It's the nature if the court proccess that you sometimes find things out as you go along.

Defence (Copeland)
*It cannot be a bar to consideration in this court that the defence did not anticipate an issue when we did not have the information. There was no disclosure from the crown on this.
*We didn't have disclosure from the crown until 3 days before the begining of this process
*Our primary position is that this was a pretext arrest and that there was no intention to investigate, not that it was a ruse used to investigate
*J: Councel insisted that I rule on the warrant before we came to the question of the arrest, this pretext theory could seriously undermine the warrant

Crown:
*The suggestion that the crown was supposed to anticipate every possible attack and interview all the police is simply ludicris
*You don't get to interview a witness, not put to them directly or indirectly that they are lying and then assert in closing statements that 
*This idea that the absence of evidence as to who was in charge is evidence of a conspiracy is ridiculous
*And what is this idea of repetedley mentionning that there was no disclosure on this until 3 day before unless the idea is to suggest that Ms Nadeau or I is asleep at the wheel. 

(If it's not clear, this was a big ugly lawyer fight.)

Adjourned until dec 12th.
