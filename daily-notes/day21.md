Byron Trial Notes, Day 21 (Week 5)
==================================

(Late start because judge had sentencing)

* Anderson takes stand.
* C: Dr. Anderson wants to clarify something from yesterday.
 * When asked about the subway bombings, what the approximate amount of explosives used in the bomb and said it was 2-3kg but it was 2-5kg. I further wanted to clarify that there were four attacks and that is the amount estimated per attack.

* D: Dr. Anderson, I believe we finished discussing how one could make TATP. And it would take you 2 to 4 hours to make 200 grams of TATP, given your experience. And it would take longer without that experience?
 * Absolutely.
* By the end of that stage, there is crude TATP. It has precipitated from the liquid, and there's still liquid that is very acidic. So what is the next step?
 * You would filter.
* Would the Buncher funnel work?
 * Yes.
* Would you agree that is a standard tool in a lab?
 * Not that kit.
* But a Buchner funnel and a vacuum?
 * Yes.
* And an alternative would be to use gravitational filter, like pouring it into something like a coffee filter?
 * Yes.
* Using the filtration apparatus, one could filter more quickly.
 * Yes.
* (New picture) Am I correct that the Buchner funnel would go on top of the rectangular container?
 * Yes.
* And you would put a filter in, or the TATP would just go through?
 * Yes.
* And you would seal it, so you could make a vacuum.
 * You don't remove all the air, but you would make a difference in pressure.
* Certainly, you couldn't make a perfect vacuum with a hand pump?
 * Yes.
* Now at some point, once most of the liquid is gone, some liquid would be left but air would start getting pulled through.
* Sometimes you wash it with Sodium Bicarbonate ?
  * Yes. I just use cold water.
* To neutralize the acid?
  * Yes.
* And in fact, any time you're working with an acid, it is a good safety precaution of have a sodium bicarbonate solution on hand?
 * Some people just use water...
* Then you would purify it with methyl hydrate
* And you wouldn't put it in type with a heating element?
 * that would be unwise.
* So you would use what is essentially be a double boiler?
 * Yes.
* So you would dissolve the TATP in boiling methanol?
 * Yes. Supersaturate it.
* And then when you cooled it would recrystalize.
 * Yes.
* And you wouldn't want to use lots of methyl hydrate with a little TATP? Because otherwise it wouldn't recrystalize out.
 * We've worked out the optimal amounts.
* Explain saturation?
 * The point you can't dissolve any more.
* Does the saturation vary with temperature.
 * You do it when it is boiling because it takes up the maximum amount.
* And that's why you cool it. Because then it would be supersaturated.
 * It's hard to keep it supersaturated...
* Then it would cyrstalize out, if there was a small impurity or crystal?
 * Yes.
* How long would that take, for 200 grams.
 * 15 min half an hour our to cool, then an hour in the fridge
* And the boiling and dissolving?
 * An hour? Two to three hours for the whole thing.
* And how long to filter the crystals out?
 * 15 minutes or so.
* And filtering it initially, I don't think I asked about it?
 * Oh a few minutes with a vacuum pump.
* So that takes 4 to 7 hours.
 * Yes, but you can have some overlap between batches.
* But you can't really do the acid adding in parallel, because it needs careful monitoring?
 * Yes. It's very sensitive.
* How much volume is 200 grams of TATP?
 * About 400 milileters.
* And if one did that 15 times, you'd get several liters of TATP?
 * Yes.
* And you mentioned you use anti-static bags to store explosives?
 * Yes.
* Would that hold any where close to six liters?
 * I think we both know the answer is no.
* And you agree that there are other uses? That they are standard for storing electronics or anything sensitive to static electricity?
 * Yes.
* Now your report is only in as a guide, but I wanted to draw attention... You say that acetone is a key component of TATP and HTMD...
 * That is an error. It is not needed for HTMD.
* Back to TATP, once one is done the filtering of crystals, would one need to do anything?
 * You need to let it dry. Put it on some TATP on paper towel and air dry?
* Now it would be covered in methanol?
 * It would evaporate...
* Would a drying box be appropriate? Would the chemicals at the bottom that pull water out work for methanol?
 * I don't really know. We air dry our TATP.
* How long would it take to air dry?
 * Yes.
* To dry it you spread it out?
 * Yes, to optimize the drying process.
* If you didn't, some at the middle or the bottom... it would take longer.
 * It would certainly...
* If you had 6 liters of TATP, you would want to spread it thinly...
 * It's a brave person that works with 3 kg of TATP.
* Now lets go to HTMD. 
* One uses Hexamine... And there are acids, but the most common is citric acid?
 * Yes.
* It's common as something one adds in canning?
 * That sounds right. I don't have personal experience.
* If one was of the things it would be used is to prevent cans you make exploding?
 * I'm not sure. 
 * I have down that you use it as a food aditive.
* Lets get into the production of HMTD...
 * I don't want to get into specific quantities.
 * I will stipulate that one wants to make HMTD in small amounts, 20 grams or 50 grams. It would take 2 to 4 hours...
* That is with your experience?
 * Yes. I've done more remotely with special reactors, but I think it is clear that nothing like that was going on here.
 * 50 grams is with my experience. You need to not just make it cold, but within a specific range.
* The first step is to dissolve hexamine it in hydrogen peroxide.
 * Yes.
* Given the quantities of hexamine present, can you indicate if the hexamine or the hydrogen peroxide is the limiting reactant?
 * Hexamine.
 * There are 10 moles of hexamine. We require 15 moles of hydrogen peroxide. The volume depends on concentration...
 * If you made the maximum of TATP, you wouldn't have enough to make the maximum amount of HTMD...
* You would have to use half the hydrogen peroxide...
* Now you add acid?
 * Yes, but since citric acid is weak, you can add it at once.
* You need to keep it in a certain temperature range?
 * For that amount, I'd be comfortable with between 20 to 30 Celcius.
* You need to actively monitor it?
 * Yes.
* And you're left with crystals and a solution.
 * Yes, but the solution isn't as acidic. And you don't need to recrystalize.
 * A few hours.
* 4 to 7 hours?
 * An expert in four, someone else would do it in 6 to 7 hours.
* And you'd have to do about 20 batches to make the full amount?
 * Yes. If you did it in small batches. 
 * Someone working outside the government...
* Now Urea nitrate?
 * Urea, add acid.
 * It crystalizes out.
 * It's a fairly forgiving process.
* I don't beleive you gave an estimate of how much urea nitrate could be produced. Could you do so?
 * No, I didn't say that.
 * ... 0.8 kilos of urea there....
* J: Lets take the morning break while Dr. Anderson calcuates.

(Break)

* Dr. Anderson, are you able to advise of the result of your calculuation as to how much urea nitrate could be produced from the ingredients found?
 * The theoretical yeild is about 1.7 kilos... When you use chemicals you can add to make nitric acid in solution, and based on a 60% yield, you get about 750 grams.
* The 1.7 kilos is if there had been a sufficient amount of nitric acid...
 * Assuming 100% yeild.
* You understand that nitric acid was not found...
 * Yes.
* And my understanding of your evidence is that you could either make nitric acid from other things either separately or in situ.
 * Yes.
* Do you have any concerns about making all 700 grams at once?
 * No, we made 10 kilos at once.
* Because it is less sensitive?
 * Yes.
* It is a secondary explosive. Where as TATP and HTMD are primary explosives. They are much easier set off.
 * They are the most primary of primary.
* Secondary explosives won't be set off if you just put a match to it?
 * They'll burn. Depending on circumstances, it could turn into an explosion.
* How long would it take to make 700 grams?
 * 2 hours.
* Wash it?
 * That's in there.
* Then dry it?
 * That would be a few hours.
* HDN?
 * Is similar to urea nitrate, and you make it the same way.
* The classic approach would involve using nitric acid, which wasn't found. There's a secondary process...
 * I should say we've never tested the secondary process. In theory it should work.
* Theoretically if one can do the in stitu process in urea nitrate, one could do it with HDN.
* How much?
 * The limiting factor is nitrate... Since you need twice as much nitrate, so you might get 500 grams.
* Over the lunch, you could do more thorough calculations?
 * Yes.
* Potassium chlorate, combined with a fuel, would create a propellant. If you confined it, it could detonate.
 * There is a serious risk associated with chlorates.
* You said potassium chlorate is used in firework?
 * Canada does not allow their import.
* A firework contains a propellant to bring it up?
 * Yes.
* There may be an explosive?
 * A tiny bit, to spread apart the colors.
* Potassium chlorate is used, in the states, is used as a fuel in rocketry?
 * I don't know the details.
* ANFO is a combination of amonium nitate and fuels?
 * Yes.
* There are different fuels you can add to amonium nitrate to make it more of an explosive?
 * Yes.
* You mentioned aluminum powder?
 * Yes.
* Depending on what you combined, it could also be used as a propellant?
 * I don't really have expertise in that.
* You blow things up, not launch them...
* Based on the chemistry?
 * I don't know that it would burn faster.
* But you could add something that would make it burn faster?
 * Possibly.
* Did you look into the possibility?
 * No.
* Do you have any resources? Perhaps online? Could you look over the lunch break or this evening?
 * Yes.
* The oxidizers we have are .. from those you can make two other oxidizers, urea nitrate or hexamine dinitrate.
* Would you just mix the oxidizer and fuel together?
 * For an explosive...
 * As a fuel, you'd need to shape it and compress it.
* As an explosive, you could take amonium nitrate prills and disel, and you would have ANFO. You could do things to improve it, grinding up ...
 * Yes.
* And you would need more amonium nitrate than fuel. 
 * Ideally you need 94% amonium nitrate by mass.
 * So it would be a damp powder.
* Grinding up the amonium nitrate, that is even more important for a fuel.
 * Yes.
* Because that would make it burn more evenly.
 * Yes.
* And then you would need to add something to hold them together?
 * Yes.
* Do you understand that Dextrin?
 * Perhaps. You could also use wax and compress it together. They'd also need to be packages.
* And you talked about pressing it together?
 * Yes... 
* And you talked about special shapes. The purpose would be to maximize the surface area exposed to the air.
 * Yes.
* You would have more of the surface of the propellant that would be propelled out the other reaction? 
 * Yes.
 * And also because you don't want it to explode
* And you want to have it burning not just up but also outwards int the cylinder...
* Now, there were ingredients found for these explosives?
 * Yes.
* And the chemicals were all stored in jars, except the drying box.
 * Yes.
* And none of the materials were in any state of preparation, besides the potassium...
 * I'd hesitate to say that... They were in a state they could be use.
* They were all under a workbench in jars?
 * Yes.
 * Hexamine was in jars on the floors, I think.
* Items in the pictures had been moved?
 * Yes
* Some of the chemicals were in different places through the house?
 * Yes
* Nothing was out?
 * Yes
 * It wasn't as though someone was right about to start a production...
* And would the drying cell have a use with the electrochemical cell?
 * Yes.
* But you'd want to use the vacuum filter, first? To increase the effiiencies?
 * If you're talking about just putting the liquid in, that would take much longer.
* So the lab equipment that was out had a clear use in the production of potassium chlorate.
 * Yes.
* You mentioned a number of items that were of concern, though not explosive.
 * Potassium permanganate could be turned into something for use in a chemical triggering mechanism.
* Other uses?
 * Disinfectant, pool shock...
* As a die?
 * You could. It's an oxidizer...
* You mentioned that one could make thermite yesterday.
 * Yes
* Regarding the electrochemical cell. You never saw it in person?
 * No, I didn't.
* Photo 28b, exhibit 57. This is an electrochemical cell?
 * Yes.
* It's a standard lab set up?
 * It's common, I don' know about standard
* One has the electrical on
 * Cathode is the negative and electrons flow to the anode...
* The type of materials of the cathode and anode is important?
 * Yes.
* And if you have the wrong type, the reaction just won't happen?
 * Yes.
* And there are several materials that would work with different efficiencies?
 * Yes.
* And the nature of the cell, the voltage across it... would effect the reaction occurring?
 * Yes.
* You said in your examination that there's a bit of magic in how electrochemical cells work?
 * It's complicated. It obviously stills work. There's competing theories.
* There's a certain amount of trial and error that can be involved?
 * Yes. There's a lot of information about that available...
* If you use the wrong cathode or anode, you could polute the material.
 * The process is such that over time your anode will break down, will shed.
* Now, you mentioned a graphite rod earlier? If you used that, it would shed?
 * Yes.
* (New picture) (Small box in window above cell)
* There's a drying material, and then sticks across the top.
* A petri dish could go inside?
 * Yes.
* If one had a petri dish with a material one wanted to dry, it might be better because it would circulate...
 * Not really
* If you had it on the prills, that would reduce the surface area by a lot?
 * Relative to the volume, not really.
* (New picture, exhibit 48. "power supplies and solenoid") 
* To clarify, the objects on the left you said are power supplies?
 * Yes
* To the right would be the solenoids?
 * Yes.
* You answered some questions in the preliminary inquiry?
 * Yes.
* And you never examined it in person?
 * Yes.
* A solenoid in an electromechanical device that moves a cylinder in and out.
 * Yes.
* And you suggested that it could be used in a detonator?
 * yes.
* How big are these?
 * 10 to 15 cm.
* And are you familiar with ones that are much smaller?
 * Yes.
* So this would be pretty bulky?
 * Yes. 
* Now, if we zoom in... It says $8.99 and then assorted DC motors. And another says assorted and has the same price... And the next one says it is a servos. And the other says it is a DC motor...
 * Let's just say they're all motors.
* They're also electro-mechanical device. They have coils and make something plug in.
 * There are DC motors and AC motors. These are DC motors from the label.
* Direct current...
 * Yes. You'd need a transformer in order to use these.
* The have uses in make, say, model cars?
 * They would.
* And they're used in printers, to move the print head around?
 * Yes.
* (next picture) Now this is a camp stove. You've said you've never seen one quite this small...
* So there's an element, and a hose, and that would connect to gas and fuel would flow in...
 * Yes.
* And there's a device to defuse the flames?
 * Yes.
* And would you agree that there is a concave section that you could put a hexamine tablet?
 * Yes. You could probably fit one.
 * It would be much more efficient to use gas.
* You could just take a few instead of taking around a whole fuel canister.
 * (pause) I don't see why you couldn't.
* ... In addition to using Hexamine as a starter, but you could use it as a fuel.
 * ... Yes.
* A single pellet might not be enough to boil a pot of water, but you could warm a beverage.
 * I've never tried and wouldn't want to comment.

(Break)

* I left you with two pieces of homework. Did you figure out how much HDM could be made?
  * 600 to 650 grams
* And the propellants.
  * I called a colleague to ask about amonium nitrate propellant. They have tested them.
* SO they are in use?
 * They've been evaluated. I can't say if they're in use.
* The hexamine tablets are cylindrical?
 * Yes.
* Sizes?
 * I'd need to look at a picture.
* OK. Kevin isn't here right now and we were using his laptop. We'll come back to that.
* Do you agree that they can also come in other shapes
 * You can also get rectangular pieces in boxes.
* Have you seen boxes with these round tablets?
 * No.
* Would you agree that a cardboard box wouldn't provide good protection from water.
 * Yes.
* And those jars probably would?
 * Yes.
* And they would dissolve in water?
 * Yes.
* And then they wouldn't be as useful as a fuel?
 * It's a long way to get there, but yes.
* Perhaps Ms. Nadaeu could help with the photos...
 * (She tries to hook up her computer to the projector...)
* Perhaps Mr. Registrar could provide the physical photo?
* Estimate the diameter of those cylinders?
 * 2.5cm by 2.
* (Next picture) You mentioned that the tube in this picture could be used for venting chlorine gas?
 * Yes, the white flexible one.
* If we zoom in on the picture, do you see how the cable is split down the middle. Wouldn't that be problematic?
 * Not really, as long as you didn't stretch it apart.
* Could it be for guiding cables?
 * ...
* (Anderson physically shown pictures) Do you agree those sort of crystals could be made from copper sulphate?
 * Yes.
* (another photo) Wood across the beaker, with a string in a vial. Does that look like a set up for making a bomb?
 * No, I haven't seen this before, but it looks like the set up for the classic sugar crystal experiment.
* Or copper sulphate crystals?
 * Yes.
* To make a crystal, you would have to heat up the water...
 * Yes, to saturate it.
* And the hot plate could have been used for that?
 * Yes.
* (next picture) (looking at blue vials on desk) These look like crystals in the process of production.
 * Yes.
* Now, lets talk about some of the chemicals the Crown asked you about.
* Acetone is a common solvent?
 * Yes.
* Used for cleaning or as a paint thinner?
 * Yes.
* Methyl hydrate has any uses other than a solvent?
 * It's wind shield washer.
* Do you agree that not all solvents are suited for all purposes. So depending on what you want to remove, some solvents might be better than others?
 * Yes.
* A face shield, dust mask... These has uses besides making bombs?
 * These are standard pieces of safety equipment.
* If you were cutting wood, you might want to wear a dust mask?
 * yes.
* Steel wool is a common house hold item?
 * Yes.
* For cleaning?
 * Yes.
* For finishing wood?
 * Yes.
* Getting stuff of pan?
 * You might scratch it.
* You were asked about PVC pipe. You said they could be to make a pipe bomb. But usually one uses a steel pipe so that it sends shrapnel...
 * Yes.
* Any sort of plastic container would serve exactly the same role that would not provide shrapnel...
 * Yes.
* One could use other metal containers and get shrapnel.
 * Yes.
* They're limited by their imagination?
 * Yes.
* Muriatic acid. Used for cleaning driveways you said?
 * Yes.
* Good at getting oil off stone or ashphult surfaces?
 * Yes.
* Good at getting rust or scales off ceramic surfaces?
 * Let me check my notes...
 * (Reads list of other uses, not on it)
* Cleaning side walk?
 * Sure.
* Cleaning fire place?
 * It wouldn't surprise me. It's a cleaning agent. A industrial cleaning agent.
* Now there are plastic tubes. You said that the the plastic tube was the wrong size for for a detonator... And that it could be used...

* Is nichrom wire is a standard wire used in heating element?
 * I don't know?
* Hair dryers?
 * I don't know.
* Wall sockets?
 * Thin nichrom wire? No.
* Toasters?
 * I don't know.
 * I know it's used in detonators and to measure the speed of explosions...
* It would be fair to say that you know about it's uses in explosives, but not others?
 * Yes
* Bag sealers?
 * I don't know.
* Another wire, different composition. Do you remember what?
 * It was contained iron...
* Please refer to the report...
* You said you thought it might be stainless steel. But it doesn't contain nickel...
 * I couldn't say if all stainless steel contains nickel.
* You can't really comment on it's uses.
* Hydrometer found in the lab, it is a standard lab tool
 * Not really a standard lab tool. Standard in detecting humidity. We have other ways to detect them in the lab.
* Hexamine is a standard camping supply?
 * Yes.
* No restrictions on their sale?
 * Yes.
* You find that concerning?
 * Yes.
* Because it has a variety of benign and malicious uses?
 * Yes.
* Amonium nitrate has a general use as fertilizer?
 * Yes.
* It a restricted substance?
 * A controlled substance. 
* If you buy over a kiligram, there's an obligation on the part of the supplier to detail who it is?
 * Yes.
* When it is mixed with water, it starts an endothermic reaction? Absorbs heat?
 * Yes. It's a component of cold packs.
* So you can go to the drug store and buy cold packs that contain amonium nitrate.
* Urea also starts an endothermic reaction when masked water?
 * Yes.
* Also used in cold packs?
 * It wouldn't surprise me.
* Hydrogen peroxide is used to bleach hair?
 * Yes.
* You could use it as a propellant in rocketry?
 * It would be a pretty elaborate set up. It would be your oxidizer and then you'd be mix it...
* Could you do it in another way?
 * I don't know. It's outside my expertise.
* Could you use platinum to catalyze it into water and...
* C: The defense is asking outside Dr. Anderson's expertise...
* D: The Crown finished by asking him whether there were any other uses... The crown first asked questions about rockets. 
* That's fair, but don't get him to speculate...
* As your general knowledge of organic chemistry, you would have experience with catalyzers like this...
 * Yes, but it would beyond my expertise in chemistry. 
* Sulfamic acid has other uses... Could you use it to make smoke trails?
 * I don't know.
* Potassium permangenate. You think it should be regulated?
 * Yes.
* Because it can burn violently?
 * Yes
* Are you aware as to whether it has improper uses in making drugs?
 * I don't know.
* ...
* Also a component of black powder?
 * Yes.
* The historical gun powder? 
 * Yes.
* Which is used in rocketry?
 * Yes.
* And in food preservatives?
 * Yes.
* And it can be used as a stump remover?
 * Yes, as a slow explosive.
* I'm going to suggest that while it may be turned into an explosive to remove stumps, by itself it can be used to encourage fungus to get rid of one?
 * Maybe.
* ... Hexachloro ethane in producing smoke?
 * Yes.
* Charcoal is an element of black powder?
 * Yes.
* And it could be used as propellant in a rocket?
 * Yes.
* Dextrin yous said could be an explosive as a glue or thickener?
 * Yes. And a fuel.
* And it could be used in a propellant as a binding agent and fuel?
 * Yes.
* Potassium chloride might be a fertilizer?
 * I'd think the chlorine would poison plants.
* It could be turned into potassium chlorate?
 * Yes.
* Wax could be used as a binding agent in a propellant?
 * Yes and a fuel.
* How much wax was found?
 * Let me check ... I don't have it. 
* ABS and PVC shavings could be used?
 * Maybe, they were a bit thick.
* They could make dark smoke?
 * Most materials can be used to make smoke.
* Potassium Carbonate Hydrate found in mislabeled jar.
* Is Potassium Hydroixde, which is what it was label, is hydroscopic.
* If it was just a bit of residue, it could react with water and carbon dioxide in the air and become Potassium carbonate Hydrate.
 * Yes. That would be a legitimate reason for it to be labeled different.
* It was the only thing that was labeled differently that what it was?
 * Yes
* Potassium chlorate, we've discussed, certainly has an application in amateur rocketry?
 * Yes.
* There was a larger box in the laundry room, the silica gel...
* ... You would agree that not all drying agents are created equal?
 * (laughs) Yes.
* Granular... can be turned into a chlorate you said. What type?
 * I don't know, because I don't know how much hypochlorate.
* Potassium chlorate you said is a lot for rocketry. Would you agree that would depends on the size and number of rockets.
 * Yes. And what you mixed.
* Restricted components act... none of these is over the limits.
 * Over vendor limits.
 * And one needs a license to make propellants and fireworks.
* Because of concerns about accidental explosions. 
 * Getting the license automatically triggers evaluation of your ability to safely produce and store them.
* Storage being the other concern, because if you have to much together it can be dangerous...

(Break)

* In your examination in chief, you were discussing some equipment that could be used in manufacturing a rocket engine?
 * A drill press and jack.
* So that I understand, rocket engines are usually packed into cylinders. 
 * That's really outside my expertise.
* I'm just trying to understand what you said in your examination.
 * You could use a drill press to press it.
* (picture) Drill press?
 * It's too bad that we didn't see another side.
* And one could use a car jack?
 * Yes.
* ...
 * That's a rather Rube Goldberg way of doing things, but would work.
* (Flicker pictures) Car jack to the right, previously hand drawn diagrams. Diamond shape of the jack, frame, and then arrows going up and down.
* If you put the car jack in a frame like that... 
 * I would agree that it is a diagram for an improvised press.
* In your evidence, you described that one time you went into a cosmetics store to buy hydrogen peroxide?
 * I wanted to see what the highest concentration I could get was.
* And you took gratification from them showing you out when you made inquiries of that nature.
 * Yes.
 * On a similar incident, I tried to buy calcium nitrate, and it triggered several alarms.
 * I'm proud of the sort of uptake there's been of these measures in Canada.
* Regarding the cold packs, you are aware of colleagues checking for them and not finding them?
 * Yes.
* Are you aware of any other colleagues testing the system?
 * ... No.
* You said that there was no other reason I for all those materials?
 * I don't know if I said exactly that, but yes.
* Many of the chemicals, you have said, had no relevance.
 * Yes.
* And would you agree that what you see is informed by your expertise?
 * Yes.
* You agree that your lack of knowledge of propellants might prevent you from seeing alternative reasons?
 * I have a general knowledge...
* And these could be for multiple reasons for the chemicals, rather than several of them.
 * Yes..
* And many are common house hold items?
 * Yes.
* Some are fertilizers?
 * Yes.
* Do you think any of this can be related to a desire to test the security of the system and raise alarms?
 * C: Objection, this is an inappropriate question.
 * J: Given the Crown's last question, I'm going to allow it.
 * (pauses)  Yes. I think it is a terrible idea, but yes.
 * (Byron laughs) (Witness laughs)
* J: I'd be interested in know about the sort of risks one would be putting themselves, their spouse and home by doing something like this without your experience at their home. I leave it to Counsel to decide whether they want to ask this question, otherwise this will be a dead issue.
* There is lots of information on this on the Internet?
 * Yes.
* And they have lots of cautionary information?
 * Yes. Lots of cautionary words are used.

(Prosecution reexamines)

* Yesterday, you said that one can calculate energy based on the size?
 * Yes, if one knows the density, and one can calculate if you know the fuel...
* How many motors would you be able to make from the chemicals present?
 * Quite a number. 
* You said you'd have to test them in designing efficient fuels...
 * Yes.
* How would you do that?
 * I'd make it and take it to a remote region to rest.
* Would 500 grams be enough TATP to make a bomb?
 * Yes.
* How much TATP do you need to be a bomb?
 * You'd need about 10 grams for a detonator.
 * ... If you were making a booster as well, 50 grams.
* Can TATP go off if you drop it?
 * If it is in a container?
* You said they could make three quarters kilograms of Amonium Nitrate... Is that a big explosion?
 * It could hurt people in a small space.
* An explosive doesn't have to be for hurting people. It could be for blowing up a safe?
 * Sure, it's a great way to apply a lot of energy.
* What about blowing up a fence or building?
 * A fence sure, maybe not a building.
* A propellant can explode under certain circumstances?
 * Yes.
* That's all.
 
* J: We haven't come back to the issue of the harddrive... Will that come up after our break?
* (yes)
* There are concerns about Officer Oullett's ability to answer technical questions.

* J: I'm familiar with underground sprinkler systems and black stakes for surface irrigation... I don't think counsel wants me to use my own knowledge.
* J: Similarly with the issue of greater than symbols for indentation and quoting. 
* J: I don't think it is appropriate for me to handle the harddrive by myself. I don't want to make a fuss over things things that are irrelevant.
* C: It was the Crown's understanding that all evidence from the pretrial would be used, though there are more.
* C: We are anticipating recalling Mr. Letch to deal with technical issues.
* C: I don't think that I can eliminate Detective Oullett
* J: The harddrive evidence ... is water under the bridge. 
* J: Taking out emails that are relevant and putting them on a CD.
* J: Copying parts of the harddrive onto the CD?
* C: ... There are things that the officers assumed were relevant, that the Crown doesn't wish to rely upon.
* J: What the Crown is relying upon needs to be teased out somehow... 
* J: ... A memory stick of emails that are tendered with consent... I'd be prepared to read those... Then there would be issues of relevance and me not understanding what things are.
* J: Memorysticks aren't that expensive any more...
* C: We're completely on board about the sprinkler system.
* J: I've already disclosed that I watch Holmes on Homes.
* C: There is one contentious witness, an expert on the magnetron. I know there will be issues of relevance and admissibility. 
* D: It's something that we raised in the pretrial. It relates to the relevance of the information about the device. 
* J: So it's not an issue of timing...
* D: And there's also an issue of the witness' expertise.
* J: If you believe that a pretrial before another judge would be useful, the please arrange that. 

* D: Since this is the last day of trial for this session, there is an issue we wish to deal with...
* D: With consent of my friend, these are other bail conditions for Mr. Sonne, that change from a form of house arrest to a form of curfew.
* J: How long has he been out of jail for?
* D: Six or seven months.
* J: That sounds reasonable. Ms. Nadeau have you looked over it?
* C: Yes, I've already signed it.
* D: There is one last thing. Kevin Tilly was called to the bar just days before Mr. Sonne's arrest... He may not be returning when we reconvene. We wanted to mark the occasion. Our firm's loss is at British Columbia's gain.
* J: I was going to ask. I'm glad to here Mr. Tilly will be continuing as a barrister somewhere. Good luck, Mr Tilly. Before you leave, could you do me one favor?
* Kevin: Of course, your Honor.
* J: Could you please give instructions to Mr. Di Luca on how to use the computer.
* (Laughs)
* Kevin: Certainly, your Honor.

* We reconvene on March 19th.
