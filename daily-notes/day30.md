Byron Trial, Day 30 (Week 8)
============================

**Summary:**  Defense finishes its closing argument.

***************

* I'd like to return, just to finish my comments regarding the Jun 23rd statement. And point out some other areas where I submit he is being truthful.
 * Transcript:
   * T: You took photos of a lot of the video surveillance that's been installed around the city. 
   * B: Yes sir.
   * T: And was your running commentary to encourage people to cause damage to those... video surveillance...
   * B: No. It was basically all about... look at how many cameras are in our city and let's make sure we know where these are so when everything goes away that these are taken back down and this hasn't been used as a reason to bring cameras into our city and then leave them there. That's it... that's it.
 * This dovetails with his emails about his plans and the the flickr comments. He's not trying to get them to destroyed, just monitor them.
 * Judge: What about the "some cameras would be easy to interfere with" tweet? Is that admissible?
 * It's concrete with a cable in it...
 * Judge: I think Mr. Byrne relied on it in the Garafoli hearing.
 * ...
 * Byron says, "Now that's secure cable management". That's completely consistent with an interest in security.
 * That's very different then encouraging to destroy it.
 * It's pointing out that it is kind of funny that they'd label it. 
 * We don't know from the evidence that it is one for the camera.
* Transcript: 
 * T: So this is a chemical compound that's set up to create fuel. Is that right?
 * B: Ah.... you mix it with sugar and then it's called candy rockets.
 * T: Why candy rockets?
 * B: Because it's made out of sugar?! And it smalls like burning... what do you call that stuff? On a cone? Um...
 * T: Candy floss.
* Not rocket fuel by itself...
* Making potassium chlorate
* Coroborates with his...
* Transcript:
 * T: What if I was to tell you that we had experts in this field look through your work room and they saw pieces of what they believe to be some kind of detonating device?
 * B: Well, I would say that I don't know what they're talking about and I can't comment until I see photos of whatever it is.
 * T: Could it be that they saw elements that are the igniting system for the rocket fuel? And interpreted that as a device... a detonating device?
 * B: I don't know what was going through their heads sir. Having said that it sounds like reasonable conjecture but I can't... can't say that.
* There was a thermocouple that was thought to be a detonator but wasn't.
* Ultimately, he's telling the truth.
* Transcript:
 * T: Rock salt? And this kind of laboratory setup with the three beakers and some kind of sieve.
 * B: I grow crystals to give to friends as gifts out of copper sulphate which is a root remover and you can purchase at Home Depot. Also entirely legal.
* This is corroborated by Dr. Anderson's evidence.
* And he also posts Flickr photos of bright blue crystals.
* I think there is a minor correction to the transcript... "I've copper sulphate" should be "using copper sulphate"
* Again demonstrates his wide spread interests.
* Transcript:
 * T: Can you explain them to me? I'm not a chemist and I'm not an engineer.
 * B: Okay, well... metal oxides... roasted starch... stuff for degassing metal because I want to get into amateur foundry work and pouring. Baking soda... fireproofing material... urea, which is a fertilizer. Ammonium nitrate which is a fertilizer which I intend to use in my garden. Let's see... what else is in there. I can't really see I'd need a clearer shot.
* A comment, to the extent that urea and amonium nitrate are used, I'll get to that later...
* Judge: He says earlier that he's an amateur farmer.
* It's an interesting point that the police never searched his garden.
* Judge: I do recall a bulletin board with two things tacked to it.
* There are seeds tacked to the bulletin board with a document bellow.
* There's also a paper pack of store bought seeds.
* Judge: Yes.
* (references photo; 0324, 0337)
* The piece of paper on the board. You can make out some words, "sister corn", and other words that seem to be related to farming, planting...
* There seems to be an inference that there is gardening.
* Mr. Supinski said as much.
* Absence of evidence suggesting that this is false, with the police not searching the back yard.
* I just want to address a potential concern about amonium nitrate. I think it is fair to infer that Mr. Sonne has interests that ebb and flow, dovetail, overlap... It's hard to say that he has a series of distinct interests. I take the primary position that the purchase of cold packs was to raise flags... Then he found himself in possession of the amonium nitrate and put it to other uses. 
* There is nothing suggesting that being an amateur farmer is a cover.
* There is nothing wrong with someone saying, I have these substances and I'm going to put them to a legitimate uses.
* Judge: Is there anything suggesting that the amonium nitrate would raise flags, he only bought a few at a time? Is there anything connecting the amonium nitrate to his purpose of...
* When judging the security system, it is equally valuable to say, this raised flags as to say this didn't raise flags.
* Imagine a presentation where someone talks about how you cant go to a farmers supply, but I could get that from Shoppers Durg Mart...
* Judge: Do we have any evidence of the number he bought?
* The receipts, but they don't add up.
* We don't know how many he bought at Shoppers Drugmart. We don't know how many they keep on the shelf at one time.
* Judge: ... We don't know if he bought the other 26 at one time?
* No. But he may have been taking all the ones that were on the shelf.
* He's out there experimenting, testing. It may not have the most rigorous scientific purposes.
* You would need to conclude that the amonium nitrate was for ANFO to convict...
* I only flag this issue because the purposes are not necessarily compartmentalized. There can be a number of reasons...
* I'd like to note that at one point on pirate bay he downloads "Rush" to "Rushlimbo...". You jump from one idea to another.
* There's nothing about an alternative use that suggests that one reason is false if there is a second use.
* He buys the hexamine. I suggest that it was likely bought to raise flags. But he puts it in jars with his camping gear, we don't know exactly how close, where he might, we have evidence of Dr. Anderson, one could use one on his camping stove as an alternative...
* My friend asked why he wouldn't have got rid of them?
* Judge: Or keep them in their original packaging?
* We don't know how long they last in the cardboard, or whether that is a waterproof container.
* He also, looking at the general set up, seems to like putting things in jars and labeling them. There isn't evidence as to whether that was a hobby by itself.
* Transcript:
  * T: A big jump in logic but can you understand how I'm curious as to why those three separate events have come together right around the G20.
  * B: Yes. And I can explain that all because I'm interested in... I'm a member of the Toronto Area Security Klatch and various other security related things... and I'm interested in just writing about these things. Getting behind the scenes... coming up with some kind of a good presentation that would maybe make my name. It would be nice to be able to get... I've got a shit name now for security probably. But to be able to come up with a good presentation to put on at T.A.S.K. afterwards about the G20. I mean like look at the cameras... here they are, they went down. This is what happened,
* We know that Mr. Sonne had a CISSP. We know how hard it was to get. We know that to keep it you need to do something like continuing legal education, giving presentations and such. And we know he's given presentations in the past.
* In volume 2, we have a print out of a presentation done by Mr. Sonne called RF counter surveillance. It's lengthy, but it speaks to his interest in the security profession. It begins with legal issues. It talks about how someone could legally do so, for nefarious purposes. He concludes his presentation with "what are some of the risks?" He talks about how humans are the weakest link and that radio can be used to gather information for social engineering. He gives an example of people of a diamond heist where someone could listen in and get information about the working of the business... It's a legitimate, useful presentation that would be of interest to security professionals.
* There is no suggestion that it is nefarious.
* There is an inference that this is how you make a name in the industry.
* And here he is, saying that this is what he was trying to do with the G20...
* Corroborated in part by Kate Milbery and the hacklab fokes.
* It would seem to be consistent, given his previous works, that he's trying to make the kind of splash presentation...
* Judge: There wasn't a draft of the presentation, was there?
* No draft. Remeber, the G20 hadn't happened yet. But it is in progress. He's going and taking pictures and documenting...
* And take one step back on the farming issue.
* In the ASF, vol 1, tab 10. The bookmark menu. Page 2 of the listing of bookmarks, a number of bookmarks that relate to food production. Seed companies, culinary plants and seeds, edible wild plants... There's some suggestion that his interests relate to that topic.
* On page 30 of his statement... Mr. Sonne notes, mid way through the top paragraph..
  * you'll see the correspondence I had with somebody where I tell them I'm very clear about wanting to follow the rules, asking for advice, and finding out that what I'm doing I cannot proceed any further on without contravening Ministry of Natural Resources, and even if I did get the licensing for that I still wouldn't be able to move it anywhere because I would need okay from Transport Canada. And you'll even see that I downloaded the forms from the government to have the detail of what exactly I need to have where... I need a land commercially zoned with a certain set aside space so that I can continue on these hobbies. You will see all of this come out that I'm interested in being just a good citizen and following the rules for these hobbies... that seem to attract peoples' attention when Obama comes to town.
* I submit there is objective verification of these items. There is the emails with the MNR. Ultimately, this might be an example of multiple interests...
* Mr. Sonne is interested in rocketry. But that's not necessarily compartmentalized. 
* His choice to send out these emails now might also be trying to raise flags, in addition to legitimate reasons.
* Judge: There is a sort of self-serving sense to this statement. I'm going to have to asses it... It seems like a very complete response that lends to Bui's suggestion... There's a timing issue, these emails were fairly late in the day. There's the chats...
* The chats aren't self-serving
* Judge: My sense from the chats is that he began, quite deep into it, and is kind of cavalier about the legality of the rockets. Then Mr. Supinski cautions him...
* He doesn't need to be linear. He might not be being careful about the regulations as much...
* You might have some concerns about rocketry being too convenient, like the Crown. If you accept that, it can be part of his testing the system.
* Transcript:
  * T: This interests me, your Canadian Association of Rocketry. It seems to me coincidental that as you are creating rocket fuel in various different forms, the liquid one and the crystal one... and the G20 is approaching... that you then also become that you then also become a member of the Canadian Association of Rocketry. 
  * B: Because I want to prove that I have no ill intent. I want to prove that I'm above board. That I follow regulations. And that's why I've never assembled any these things, any of these chemicals into a finished device. And that's what makes some of these charges so ridiculous. Is that I don't actually possess anything that is a finished explosive... that you guys keep on [ui] to me.
* Judge: This would suggest an alibi...
* He's a smart guy. How's such an alibi supposed to work? He's doing everything publicly.
* I think it's a hobby, but it is equally conceivable that he was setting up an "aha" moment for the police, to show how it was a false positive.
* If he wanted to make a bomb, why do it publicly.
* Judge: I appreciate that. But I have to look at everything globally as well.... But the comment seems to suggest an alibi. His response is because "I want to prove I have no ill intent". He talks about precursors... It undermines the suggestion of a legitimate interest
* Could it be a dual purpose? He doesn't just make the chlorate, he designs the press for making rocket engines. Sketches, buy the press, getting a wormgear. Anderson agrees that the sketches...
* If it is a front, why is he working on the press?
* Judge: Did Dr. Anderson suggest a connection between the press and the explosive?
* No such evidence before you.
* Judge: You accept that the chemicals were there and that they could be turned into explosives. So it comes down to intent.
* Yes...
* But it is telling that, say, the acids are in the garage.
* When Dr. Anderson sees chemicals being used for explosives...
* Judge: But some the substances are just things you might have, like the acids, while others are things for triggering a search.
* My friend talked about the precursor research. It's actually a bit more nuance than that.
* Application for a precursor license. On the third page--
* Judge: This is around the time he tried to get potassium permangenate.
* "Application for class A precursor license"
* Under background, "this does not relate precursor explosives, but chemicals that are frequently diverted to the manufacturing of drugs"
* Next page, appendix; item number 15 is potassium permangenate.
* Judge: I just assumed this document had something to do with rocketry or... you say the background relates to drugs.
* An inferences arrises that he hears about the potassium permangenate and decides to get it to raise flags. So he researches it...
* Judge: But he clearly knows that it is used in explosive?... I guess if one was to google potassium permangenate explosive...
* Does he know that potassium permangenate has use in explosives? Probably...
* Based on his email to Kate Milbery... Testing the system.
* He tries a cross boarder order using his name, credit card and address for it.
* Folder: "Chemistry, energetics, rocketry..." is created in January and a number of websites are filed under it. A number of things...
  * Chlorates was created earlier and later moved in...
  * Bucket cell adapter bookmark created on may 2nd.
  * Richard ... site, added may 29th.
* (Bucket cell adapter)
* Chat seems to suggest that Mr. Sonne tried one at it didn't work very well...
* Chats on Monday 17th of may there are three emails... Receipt from Canadian tire.
* ...
* If his intent was to make explosives, if he has 2.5 kilos of amonium nitrate, why go into the whole process of getting something that is traditionally related to propellants and not explosives...
* Judge: I'm somewhat confused by the potassium nitrate. It's listed in the indictment... But Anderson's evidence seems to be incomplete.
* I think he said it could be, but was usually a rocket propellant.
* Rocket engine from chlorate and sugar, aluminimum powder...
* Judge: I'm not sure he said "traditionally" but... He talks about ANFO and so on... 
* It's just odd that if he was intent on making explosives...
* Maybe he's coming to a new area of chemistry and is looking at possible permutation.
* There is a website bookmarked "potassium nitrate from amonium nitrate". We know potassium nitrate can be used from gardening, and while it can be used as an explosive is much weaker. 
* It almost looks like he's looking for alternative purposes for gardening...
* If your honor finds that he knew the right way to make the rocket fuel and didn't follow it, so be it. That's not an offense he's charged with.
* My friend suggested earlier that a rocket fuel would be an explosive.
* Judge: It's not pleaded.
* Yes. And it stands to reason that it isn't an explosive. Recall that Ms. Nadeau brought in rocket engines earlier. I don't think she's licensed.
* There's a different between a propellant and an explosive.
* If I intent to make a propellant and something goes wrong and there's an explosion... It may be criminal negligence...
* Judge: And besides that, it is not one of the charges... I'm going to have to decide what an explosive is.
* And you'd still have to deal with the intent.
* Judge: ...
* You may hae committed a regulatory offense by not having the right permit... But that's not an explossive.
* Judge: An itent to make an explosive device...
* Judge: I don't know if Dr. Anderson said whether a propellant is an explosive?
* He certainly differentiated between the two and said that there was a chemical difference... Obviously, this is a legal issue which he isn't qualified to opine on. And he also talked about how something that isn't an explosive can make a pipe bomb.
* Judge: Given the broad definition of an explosive... An aresol can would be?
* Yes.
* Judge: So it needs to look at intent?
* Yes. I wouldn't want to see Ms. Nadeau charged for explosives for bringing rocket engines into a courtroom.
* Judge: Yes, though I'm sure that is covered...
* Mr. Sonne tries to get nitric acid, although he never gets it. It's an ingredient in a number of things. That would be consistent with...
* There were ways to get away the absence of nitric acid. The theoretical in stitu method. But you would need to find that he had an intention to make nitric acid with a distillation device he didn't posses or using the in stitu process.
* Judge: ...
* Dr. Anderson explains that there was a process you could use.
* Judge: In other words, one of the essential ingredients needed to have something done to it and maybe get a distillation aparatus...

**Break**

* I'd like to highlight some things in the second statement.
* "If you blow up our house, I'm going to be really mad".
* He responds: probably related to the microwave cannon. Verifiable, look at his blog.
* Asked when he bought the cold packs. He's open about it. We know from receipts there are correct. Actually, that may have been excluded, in which case I'll leave it out
* Crown: In the chronology...  should be march 9th.
* In terms of the excerpts of Mr. Sonne's blogs which have been put before the court. The blogs speak for themselves... 
* Mr. Supinski was a reluctant witness in some areas, but if you reject his evidence that doesn't become evidence of the mens rea.
* Err... I mean chats.
* Judge: I'm assessing the veracity of the chat without evidence from an author, then...
* Judge: The chats you're referring to...
* You might reject that his evidence... But consider that he was asked a very specific question. "Was Mr. Sonne making rocket fuel?" But Mr. Sonne was making potassium chlorate which isn't in itself rocket fuel.
* Judge: Very specific. Yes... But I'm still concerned about his responsiveness.
* But it may have been an issue of being concerned of being connected.
* Judge: That was my sense... 
* Judge: He was very particular...
* ...
* Judge: He doesn't support Mr. Sonne having been making rocket fuel.
* Joke aoubt "going for level 4 already".
* Mr. sonne said "Only started small sacle electrolysis, tried medium"
* I believe there were three buckets.
* (confusion about a drying chamber)
* I can give you a reference to the exact photos.
* Mr. Sonne talks about using different processes...
* Request for "a good stepper driven worm gear, half the fun is making the tools"
* Judge: This is before getting a...
* What to say that he's going to 
* Judge: There seems to be an inference about indifference about legality.
* Mr. Supinkski is telling him that he needs a license to make a rocket fuel. He's just making the chlorate, which is just an ingredient for the fuel.
* Talking to elmood, he talks about not being in a rush, rocket a year away.
* We see him asking for a link.
* Mr friend has asked why someone of Mr. Sonne's sophistication would use a chat to ask for it that just googling. Perhaps he forgot the name. Perhaps he wants it from his friend...
* Comments suggest that Mr. Sonne sees making the fuel as separate from the chlorate... Getting licensed before hand...
* Discussion of whether it is cheaper to make rocket fuel himself...
* Talks about stopping here because he doesn't like having so much of an oxidizer around the house.
* Then there's a discussion about the risk.
* I don't know what to believe. [about the risk] ... Idiots using sulphur... 
* Talks about idiot who smacks TATP with a hammer and blows himself up.
* He's about to stop. He isn't making fuel yet. He's stopping because of regulatory and safety issues...
* Next chat, talking about CAR again.
* My friend asks why would he ask three times? 
* Judge: It's a good question.
* Look at the list of bookmarks on his computer. On page 12, you'll see the CAR website. Added on June 7th at 18:15:55.
* At 18:14 he's on chat asking if this is the right site.
* Get's an answer at 18:15 saying yes.
* Given NAPAS at 18:16
* At 18:17 he makes a bookmark at NAPAS.
* Does he ask for an obvious webiste? Yes. But then he makes a bookmark.
* It's not that much of a cover in any event.
* It strikes me that he just forgets and wants to make sure he's in the same club as his friend.
* Discussion of blowing people away with a presentation.
* Photo of the press for the motor gets uploaded on the same day.
* Later...
* Byron talking to Fredrick. Talked to a guy from CAR about making engines...
* Email response (found ASF 1 tab 12) was sent at 7:52pm that day. Minutes later, at 8:06 he's on chat talking to fredrick.
* Maybe he was a bit absent-minded. 
* Talks about what he would have to do to make rocket fuel.
* Says he's still going to join CAR or NAPAS.
* Talks about how someone may already have everything sorted out.
* He's not giving up on the project.
* Suggests projects often have twists and ebbs.
* Then jokes about background tests... He did for PAL, PI and CISSP.
* Judge: When was PI?
* We can find a date...
* While I'm sure he legitimately is interested in these. But... there's a neat aside where he goes through security checks...
* ... (discussion of dates of licenses, promises to get dates)
* Judge: I recall a hunting reference, so guns would make sense.
* In his bookmarks...
* Getting a PAL would be one way to see if you've raised a flags.
* He's clearly legitimately pursuing these interests.
* Clearly interested in making rocket engines. The press, the binding agents...
* One of the last things the police officers see Mr. Sonne doing is buying zinc oxide and iron oxide. 
* We know that they're both used in explosive. 
* Judge: Do those make smoke?
* Yes. No use in military, because you don't want people to see...
* Also some use in pyrotechnics.
* Judge: Is there any evidence in pyrotechnics?
* It's interesting. Perhaps we are seeing an embryonic snap shot of an interest in pyrotechnics.
* Sites last visited in the time immediatly proceeding his arrest. The first page, the second entry is www.pyrotechnics.com, next is oxidizing ..., next is pyrocreations.com "buy fireworks and learn how to make fireworks" On page 3, 15:06 he's going to Wouter's pyrotechnics page... Mixing, safety, bunch of searches about Wouter, practical pyrotechnics, massive chemistry and explosive book. 
* Chemistry of pyrotecnics...
* How are fireworks made part 2?
* We're seeing the start of an interest in pyrotechnics.
* Judge: Is there any interest in the statemnt to Bui about pyrotechnics?
* No.
* And the last document Mr. Sonne uploads to Pirate Bay is a book "practical pyrotechnics" by Wouter. That's found in the ASF 1, second page. 
* Judge: How do I know it is the last one?
* It's the first one on the list. 
* Visiting tucker's pottery, looking at zinc oxide.
* A number of visits to dies and colors and the like
* Judge: also ceramics
* More searches of iron oxide and zinc oxide...
* Whether ultimately he was moving away from rocketry, making them glow different colors, or move into pyrotechnics... His interest is splitting, changing...
* Judge: visiting setting fires with electrical timers?
* Uploaded on Jan 1st. He could be doing a lot of things. He could be doing what he told Kate Milbery, checking it to see interest. 
* Judge: What's the evidence that he was looking at the downloads to see if others were downloading things?
* He told Kate Milbery that he was doing that.
* And he's there for a very short period of time.
* He goes next to finance groups on Yahoo...
* There's some common things linking rocketry explosives and pyrotechnics.
* There's an inference that his interest in rocketry is legitimate and that one is forming in pyrotechnics.
* And that is the snap shot at the end of the chats.
* If you're honor finds it to be a front, it is consistent...
* What sort of cover would it provide? They're going to come to your door, since you bought all this stuff. He would have been better off not being public.
* ... Gets cheque for CAR or NAPAS.
* Talks about needing an explosive manufacturing license.
* Cherry bomb an interest in pyrotechnics?
* Now, looking at charges a count of having an explosive or "urea nitrate and HDN". Which? Both? And then it continues to include chemicals to make it. What is it? Both?
* Judge: Yes, it is worded as though urea nitrate goes into HDN.
* Now count 4...
* Judge: Before that, what do think of the indictment?
* The crown wrote the indictment. The court needs to say whether it is one or both, and the Crown needs to hold it up as stated. If they mean both, then the Crown must prove both HDN and urea nitrate for the charge.
* Judge: You have urea nitrate and HDN. That doesn't suggest, on the face of it, that they would be combined... I don't know how this should be interpreted...
* What intent is required to make out that count.
* Judge: Yes. Is it sufficient for the crown to proven either or? Do they need to prove both? Or is it just fatally flawed because it says a a single one, and then has both?
* Even if we fix it to be "possessing explosive substances ... or ingredients for one..." It would still be a single charge for two things.
* One would have thought they'd split it.
* Judge: I've heard of such things being rewritten in some cases... Or is it fatally flawed?
* It isn't necessarily fataly flawed, ... but in reading it, it should be read in the way most beneficial to the accused. That the charge is making both.
* On count four, Amonium nitrate is not ANFO. It only becomes ANFO when you add fuel oil to it. 
* Judge: The count describes amonium nitrate and potassium nitrate as oxidizers. You'd have to add a fuel to make an explosive...
* Yes.
* Judge: But TATP and HTMD are the actual explosives.
* Judge: We're going to need to hear from Ms. Nadeau about that.
* Judge: Is your position that it would be need ANFO?
* It was Dr. Anderson's evidence that...
* Judge: You're raising a technical defense... I need to know how serious you are about these. You've given a position on the third...
* This isn't our primary defense. We're just trying to cover as much ground as possible.
* Judge: I'm not faulting you for raising it. I just need to being my decision with the charges and what they mean.
* Judge: When I've had things like this, it proceeds on consent.
* Judge: But this doesn't seem to have been an ambush on you.
* Judge: Errors like date and place.
* This goes beyond date and place, your honor.
* Judge: Yes. And this is a criminal trial...
* Judge: If you could have some discussion with Ms. Naduae.
* Subject to completing that issue, we'll deal with the counseling charge.

**Lunch**

* Crown: I've had discussions with Mr. DiLuca, and per 601(3)(b) do ammend count 3 to read as "... did unlawfully posses explosive substances to wit urea nitrate and or hexamine dinirate (HDN) and or the ingredients to make them..
* I am further seeking "He did unlawfully have explosive substances, to wit..." leave it out, except remove the ANFO part.
* Judge: No mention of fuel?
* No. For making oxidizer based explosives.
* Judge: What is the defense's position?
* .. (can't hear)
* Judge: I can certainly see why you'd want it clarified.
* Especially with mens rea.
* Judge: But there doesn't seem to have been prejudice to the defense.
* It would have unfolded the same way.
* Judge: The motion is granted.

* Defense: One final matter. If your honor finds that making rocket fuel falls under making explosives, I think your honor will need to consider the issue of abandonment and the most recent posts we've seen. To the extent he was making chlorate for rocket fuel, it was stopped or put on hold. That's way down the chain of reasoning, but I wanted to mention it.

* Now, regarding counseling mischief not committed.
* The tweets are in the ASF. Three are on June 18, two on June 19.
* Judge: Does the counseling include the cable in joint photo? Can you clarify, Ms. Nadeau?
* Just the fence. The others add context.
* In terms of the actis rea, we knwo from the case law, especially with Hamilton. "Actively in use or advocate and do not merely describe the commission of the Defense."
* The Supreme court split on the mens rea, but the agreed on the actis rea.
* Hamilton builds on Sharp, which was provided to the court. And if I can take you to a couple paragraphs...
* Par 56, 
* Written child pornography, at the time, required encouraging...
* Against material which suggests that sex should be perused with children.
* Effectively tries to carve out descriptions of an offense versus encouraging.
* So, the question becomes did Mr. Sonne just describe how or tell people that they should?
* One describing how an offense can occur is not criminal.
* Within which the actis rea needs to occur.
* It's meant to draw a line in the sand.
* And there is a problem with the evidentiary basis here. We do not know if these are originating tweets or responding tweets. 
* This is an important issues. Looking at Ferris and Hunter, it is very important to see an accused's statement.
* We don't know what the question is, if there is one. And it would be for the Crown to provide it to you.
* It's clear, looking at the tweets, that there are elements of a discussion.
* Tweets are limited in context because you only have a certain number of characters. You can't tweet a whole paragraph.
* We can start with the first one, tweet 25. "These would be handy for scaling G20 fences, the ones I have at home... #g20report" That tweet would have gone to #g20report and anyone following Byron. We don't know if this was part of a discussion about the fence. Certainly, it was a topic of public discussion."
* Judge: Was there anything on hacklab?
* ...
* 2 minutes later, cheap fabricating... Could be a response to a question.
* Because the next one is 16 seconds later, we might guess its a continuation. But between 25 and 24 there may be a question.
* I'm not sure this is a description of an offense. It's pointing out a flaw in security which has a different intent. But how does that become active inducement our counseling?
* June 19, 2010. "Don't forget design flaw in most G20 fence..." Do we know if that is a response to someone else pointing out a security flaw, or a question, or who knows what. It almost strikes one as being part of a dialogue.
* Next "See what I mean? Tiny holes." with a link to a picture of the fence.
* A tweet "@3ric: ... " is certainly a response.
* How weaver you decide that, you have to decide if this is just a description or an encouragement.
* You have the evidence of Mr. Supinski that if you find a flaw you put it out there. You might not put the password out there...
* He said it depends on the case.
* Despite the fact that Mr. Supinski wouldn't point out specific things...
* And pointing out you can thread a bolt is not giving out a password. And in fact, it is almost ironic that such a height tech fence...
* It doesn't really describe how to pull it down, just that you could get a grip.
* The caption on the Flickr photos. Photo of two treesteps. "Treesteps for climbing fences or getting a grip to pull them down."
* It is likely that relates to the ...
* Even assuming he's saying that and the context is correct. He's saying, at very worst, "here's how you can do ..."
* Judge: Earlier you were saying that this isn't a description of...
* I'm responding to the Crown..
* Judge: I understand they don't know anything more...
* Judge: And the context goes to the actis rea?
* Yes, we need to asses whether they...
* Nothing less than a conscious disregard ... either intended that the offense be committed or know that they're likely to...
* Judge: It seems to me that step 1 is do these tweets describe the offense. I think there's a good argument that they do. I don't see how the context would matter here.
* Judge: Then I need to go to the second part, the counseling part, and that's where context matters.
* It could even fall on the first...
* Judge: I can certainly see how the context matters for mens rea.
* Judge: I'm having trouble seeing how the context matters for part 1.
* It theoretically can. Factually here, the tweets can... He killed her
* Judge: That's an admission though. I can't see how context matters to whether...
* Judge: If the tweets don't get to the level of advocating, that's a problem and the lack of context is important.
* If there's already a discussion about ...
* On the issue of active inducement and encouragement, context is important.
* Judge: Beyond describing the offense, I don't see any more... I don't see any active encouragement. You're saying that's part of the actis rea...
* And you have the back drop of this being a highlighted security feature of the fence.
* In Hamilton there's language encouraging, "think of the life style", etc. 
* I accept that the active inducement can be implicit.
* A justice refers to the advertising. A bunch of good looking people drink bear...
* But Mr. Sonne lacks the language... 
* No positive comments or language.
* In some contexts, you might be able to infer...
* It's public, and on that matter, Jeffers. Mr. Jeffers put up posters about killing his city counselor. He was convicted and over turn. One thing that the court identified was that he was easily identified, so it seems like a strange thing to advocate murder. 
* Judge: But around the G20 there was lots of criticism. It might not be so socially unacceptable?
* It's a different context.
* ...
* It seems to fall far short of Jeffers, even.
* There's no context suggesting Mr. Sonne was trying to get people to disrupt...
* To the extent Mr. Sonne is involved in G20 stuff, he's a *ringleader* or something like that, where he might be encouraging 
* Subject to any questions, those are my submissions.

**Crown**
* The Hamilton case referred to recklessness. He's using the g20report hashtag. He follows g20mobilize. The Toronto Community Mobilize Group. You've seen their mail outs. They were a group intent on causing chaos on the G20. This isn't the surveilance club. Were it, the Crown would likely not be pursuing this.
* It's not a passing comment, he's posting pictures.
* Talks about 151 front street. 
* Talks about design flaw.
* The implication is clear.
* And if it wasn't he posts the security culture pamphlet and tells everyone of practice good security culture.
* Judge: Do we have the pamphlet?
* Yes. It's a pamphlet designed to help people avoid detection of their criminal activity.
* He's persuading and encouraging.
* Judge: You're inferring... We don't have all the tweets.
* Crown: ...
* Judge: We don't have all the tweets. I don't see anything in the tweets per se... They describe how to... 
* Judge: I don't see anything...
* It's a public forum, but it is a targeted group.
* If it was #securityflaws, this would be different. This is to a group that is targeting to wreak havoc.
* Judge: That could go to the mens rea. But... on the actis rea, there needs to be active inducement.
* But the cases are clear... And the inducement needs to be taken in context. He's talking about security culture. He's not going to say anything that, from his perspective, is incriminating.
* If he said "I hope the people inside are safe, there..." 
* Judge: You're saying that because I don't know everything, I should infer...
* Unless Mr. DiLuca can suggest an innocent conversation we might be seeing.
* Judge: For the first part... But the second part, encouragement, needs context.
* Judge: You're saying that, looking at the context, he must have known he would encourage people.
* And, further, that it is the only reasonable inference.
* Judge: But there's no comments actively encouraging.
* And there wouldn't be. He's advocating security culture.
* Judge: If these tweets are part of the conversation identifying design flaw in the fence, how would that be counseling?
* It wouldn't.
* Judge: So if there is a reasonable inference that there was a conversation going on involving identifying design flaws and nothing more.
* Yes.
* Judge: The part that disturbs me is that things are missing.
* Judge: I agree that, in this context and the G20, this was an irresponsible to do. But I'm not just trying to establish...
* This is a guy who was going around posting pictures of police and labeling them "stationary bacon"
* Judge: I don't disagree that that is one inference. The trouble is that it is not the only one.
* Judge: I don't know that the offense was made out...
* ...
* We don't know who Kate Milbery is, besides the fact that there is someone who calls themselves Kate Milbery and lists credentials. Mr. Sonne could have legitimately be interested in her thesis... 
* If Mr. Sonne was interested solely interested in teh security aspect of her email... Why is he mentioning this security pamphlet?
* For all we know, this Kate Milbery could be an activist.
* Why would he keep stuff?
* The purposefully raising flags is an elegant argument, but it just isn't born out on the facts.
* The cold packs, which is the amonium nitrate and one gets the impression from Dr. Anderson is the scariest.Your honoro has seen the vast number of prills. The cold packs weren't all purchased on the same day, so they weren't raising flags.
* It doesn't bare out on the Hexamine either.
* Judge: So what you're saying is that cold packs weren't purchased in a way that would raise flags?
* Yes... (talks about numbers)	
* Judge: Hardly what's going to raise flags.
* The Hexamine tablets are the same argument. Four packets were bought on January 29th, and less the other. Your honor has seen the number.
* Again, this is not something that would raise flags. If you were trying to raise flags, you would buy all of them at the same place and on the same day.
* Judge: But the Hexamine is found with the camping equipment and would be found in Canadian Tire.
* Sure. But it was bought in *Jaunary* and we have no record...
* Judge: I don't know that I can draw that inference.
* I would encourage you to review the evidence of officer Albright.
* He didn't think they were in the camping equipment, but beside it, beside the other shelf and the bench...
* Why would you store them water tight at you home? If you were taking them camping...
* Judge: Maybe he was getting ready for the camping season. Maybe...
* Why not use a zip lock bag?
* Judge: Maybe, but I need to establish that there is not another reference.
* I'd suggest it is not a coincidence that it is in the same jars as the...
* Judge: ...
* Now regarding Mr. Sonne's statement, coincidentally not under oath...
* He's clearly speaking for his own interest.
* He's not terribly surprised when he was arrested.
* And if you're trying to get arrested, why don't you have a failsafe plan? Why don't you have a note that you've already written? He isn't worried at first, but he gets worried...
* When he says that the candle aren't candles, but he doesn't say what they are.
* Judge: But there's nothing wrong...
* Judge: He knows his rights...
* ...
* He was being fairly careful with what he said. 
* Judge: The Defense is clearly relying on this statement, when it wasn't given under oath, no cross. I understand that.
* Judge: But you're doing the same thing. The tweets or the emails...
* ...
* You honor knows that he's not trying to...
* He's not...
* He shuts down when Bui asks him about...
* Judge: I understand that. If Mr. Sonne had testified, this would be different.
* In the course of this trial, you have heard a vast amount of evidence.
* Mr. Sonne was asked about the computer.
* It's incomplete.
* This whole presentation theory. This is based on his countersurveilance, which isn't on anything as serious as bombs.
* We have no notes about a presentation. No evidence from Mr. Supinski.
* ...
* If you "to tie the explosives to tightly into anything to do with the G20 it's really a distraction."
* The suggestion by Mr. DiLuca... 
* Nothing to suggest that there is a presentation regarding the gather of explosive precursors.
* That is something that would need evidence, whether from Mr. Sonne or someone like Kate Milbery.
* Judge: Didn't detective Bui ask about...
* Judge: let's suppose there is nothing in his statement... You're not suggesting that, because Mr. Sonne didn't testify I can't find that inference?
* Not because of that, but because there is no evidence.
* Judge: Obviously, there could have been more evidence. But the onus is on the Crown to prove.
* Judge: What Mr. DiLuca has done is using the same evidence.
* The defense is putting forward two theories. There's the innocent explanation of making rocket fuel, and also the theory that Mr. Sonne was working on a presentation.
* The presentation theory is complete speculation
* Because you're putting together a presentation, you want to document... And you also want to protect yourself. Because if you tickle the Dragon, it's coming after you and you want to cover your own behind.
* That could very well be that the scope is what he was talking about with Kate Milbery.
* Or the sketchy torrents.
* None of that is explosive chemicals.
* Judge:
 * Count 1 there's the issue with the acetone
 * Count 2, there's the draino and so intent is more important.
 * Count 3, there's the chlorate, which has the rocket fuel.
 * Count 4, amonium nitrate is for his garden.
* Crown: Yes. He's getting it for garden. (Crown laughs) He gets it in march and doesn't use its June and he hasn't use it.
* Potassium chlorate
* Judge: It would appear that the potassium chlorate can used for both explosives and and propellants.
* Of course if you're making explosives, he knows the innocent explanations.
* Judge: The point that Mr. diLuca made to me ath made some sense is that there is a different between making Potassium Chlorate and making the rocket engine and that is different. Whether that is factually the case is different...
* Judge: If I find that it is plausible that he was making rockets.... Is that still making explosives?
* He was making it before he was interested in rocketry.
* Judge: Anything beyond...
* Judge: Is there any case law? Obviously, WD is engaged.

**Break**

* Judge: I don't want to rush the last bit. If you want to provide me any further references...
* Now, the rockets they got are not potassium chlorate.
* And I take issue with my friend saying that Dr. Anderson is classically a propellant.
* Judge: A rocket is not normally considered an explosive device.
* ..
* Judge: To be clear. If I were to find a reasonable inference that what Mr. Sonne did was to make rocket fuel, would that be an explosive device?
* Yes...
* Judge: ...
* Judge: Potassium chlorate, combined with fuel, can be turned into an explosive device... It could be the one that sets off the device.
* ...
* If your honor finds that it was only being made...
* Judge: I don't think that's the onus. You need to establish...
* ...
* Judge: So you concede that a rocket is not an explosive device?
* Yes.
* Judge: If I find Mr. Sonne was...
* No.
* Mr. Sonne was clearly well versed in the criminal code.
* ...
* In any event, he's going to make potassium chlorate.
* It's only later that there's any discussion of rockets.
* Lots of links to farming in the bookmarks. But those were from much earlier. Nothing added to that after November.
* One of the problems with the whole rocket cover is....
* Judge: Why would you need a cover if you didn't do it in a pulic forum.
* In some point in March or April...
* It seems quite clear that in June, his obsession with the G20, he is certainly under another microscope. He now needs a cover.
* ...
* Judge: Why do everything under his name.
* Well, he only does that for some things.
* He tries to get it on a bunch of things.
* He thought he was raising flags by getting quotes. Why go the further step of actually buying them and keeping them. There's massive holes.
* He doesn't publicly mention his large potassium chlorate device.
* He joins CAR and NAPAS and says he's going to hook up with someone with the right license. He does go to CAR...
* The response from...
* By law... engines are explosives just as fireworks are explosives.
* You have to consider abandonment, my friend says. He found out on June 8th and on June 22nd it was still going.
* Judge: How do I know that it was on going?
* Well, it was all hooked up. And Dr. Anderson...
* Judge: So he was able to say that it was on going?
* That was my understanding of his evidence.
* My friend indicates that you wouldn't want smoke or colors with a bomb, but sometimes you want bombs to be discrete and sometimes you don't.
* One document is unconventional warfare. Information about initiators which include potassium permanganate.
* Information on improvised string fuses, aluminum powder.
* A number of things you'll see that match things in Ragner's guide.
* Document 394... 
* Information on magazines, not in the common use of the word I think, about storage of explosive substances.
* Crossreference that with the chat.
* Potassium chlorate... couldn't set it up.
* Storage magazine in my backyard.
* This is clear reason to believe Mr. Sonne had read the military documents.
* Rocketry doesn't come on the radar until June.
* These interests are just small deviations from the consistent interest in explosives.
* I think I've addressed everything, but...

**Defense**

* Judge: Is there anything else about tickling the dragon...?
* At the end of the Kate Milbery email, he signs off, I'd be happy to talks about presentations. He refers to chemicals he's bought earlier.
* In his interview with Bui he talks about wanting to write about these things, to do a presentation... to do a presentation at TASK.
* The calendar entries suggest another presentation, and he also did a presentation at SoOnCon.
* His comments everywhere indicates...
* Judge: ...
* Part of his presentation may have been what he was able to do without raising flags. And the fact that he was able to do things without raising flags doesn't mean he wasn't trying to.
* You're not required to be satisfied that this was the case, just have doubts raised.
* Regarding the potassium chlorate... Dr. Anderson says it was Mostly chloride. That would suggest that it is already done or about to do another. Completely consistent with these chats.

* Judge: Anything else?
* No.
* Judge: I have next week to work on this...
* Judge: What I'm prepared to do is to put everything the week after next week. But if I need to put it off further...
* What I would like to do is prepare...
* Crown: I will leave it 
* (scheduling discussion)
* Monday the 23rd?
* Judge: That would give me more time 
* ...
* Judge: 10am on the 23rd.
* Judge: I'd like to thank everyone for their assistance and I'll see you on the 23rd.
