 * Yes.

   * People walking around g20 zone with ...
   * Why would you be recording G20 events if you aren't preparing for violence? Tired of the echo chamber...
    * Defense: The witness is editorializing. No evidence this is a response, just that it is in the database.
    * Judge: No @torongogoat
    * Witness: this was found on Byron's computer. It's common sense to believe he had access to them.

Unallocated Space on Harddrive
-------------------------------

* Let's go to the thumb drive.

  * Yes.
