 * I am biased towards Byron, though I try to be objective. For the
full picture, it would be ideal for you to read the notes of a person
with the opposite bias
 * I have fine motor difficulties and can't write at anywhere near
the speed of speech. As such, I have to choose what I write down and
care rarely record quotes. As such, my notes are not a complete record
of what happens at the trial and are biased towards what seems
important to me.
 * It is sometimes hard to hear what is going on in the trial.

Trial, Day #1
=========

**Summary:** After some introductory dialogue, we move to the question of when Byron was first detained. Byron first came to their attention for taking pictures downtown shortly before the G20. The police put out a high-priority call for him and tracked him down. He refused to identify himself, so the police threatened to arrest him for jay-walking, though they admit he never did. Clearly, by the time they performed this 'ruse,' they were detaining him... But when did the detention begin?

* Judge has read:
 * Notice of applications
 * Statements
* Defense: Judge should look over French transcript
* Charter issues should be resolved first, since they will determine
the approach to the trial
* Evidentiary basis:
 * Preliminary Inquiry
 * Prosecution: doesn't object, but may wish to add more
* The charges are read. Byron pleads not guilty on all counts.
* The Defense is trying to get French's ITOs
* French says he based the affidavit on a precedent, not his but
someone else's. Unfortunately, he can't find it.
* Defense: Officer French misled Justices on affidavit, plastic world,
pottery store.
* Judge: "dealers" and "proceeds of crimes" are from a narcotics case,
in her mind.
* will-say from constable French

Section 9 issue
----------------------

* The video from officer Simon's car of the jay-walking incident has been located.
* At beginning, Officer Simon is in the car.
* Bicycle officers, Wang & Coffin arrive.
* Video meta-data shows cruiser lights on.
* Simon testified they were necessary in order to get the car to film.
* Crown concedes that once Wang uses the J-walking ruse, Mr. Sonne was under detention [and that it was illegal].
* Defense: Once Mr. Sonne was sandwiched between the flashing car and
a police officer, signifying that he isn't leaving, that would surely
be detention. If not, surely when officer Wang arrived with his bike
or a further officer with another bike, that would signify detention.
 * Mr. Sonne corralled in front of the police car
 * He's boxed in
 * He is physically unable to leave without asking them to move
 * All officers testified that he was free to leave
 * Mr. Sonne was just a person taking pictures to them
* Defense has no issue with them talking to Mr. Sonne, but they had no
reason to detain him.
* Mr. Sonne didn't identify -- as is his right.
* Officer's referred in testimony to Mr. Sonne having a piece of paper
about a legal hotline and that he doesn't have to identify unless
charged under a particular terrorism related section of the criminal
code.
* Prosecution: Once ruse started, Mr. Sonne was detained and had the
right to counsel.
* Defense: Officer made a "don't move gesture" with his hand
* The conversation implies dissatisfaction with Mr. Sonne's answers
(in context: refusal to identify) and that it wasn't ending there.
* Certainly, there is the threat of arrest if Mr. Sonne doesn't identify.
* The police didn't write down the ruse in their notebooks
* This ruse is clearly intended to subvert basic exercise of
constitutional rights
  * Different from an undercover officer using a ruse
* prosecution: A police officer talking to someone is not a detention
-- even if the questions are investigative in nature
* <precedent of above is given>
* Judge: Is there anything Mr. Sonne says that suggests he knew he
didn't have to answer questions? That he was free to leave?
* prosecution: No, but it didn't come up.
* prosecution: Mr. Sonne refusing to identify means he understood his rights.
* prosecution: officer testified that Mr. Sonne said he knew his
rights and didn't need to identify. He produced a piece of paper about
not needing to identify unless investigated for terrorism. Then they
did the ruse.
 * The ruse results from Mr. Sonne citing of the terrorist act
* Prosecution: Mr. Sonne clearly understands he doens't need to
identify. Or answer, as I recall.
*Defense:
 * Officers weren't interested in much besides his name.
 * Officer testified about Byron answering questions about what he was doing
 * hot shot call, priority call
 * targeted in the sense of trying to get identity
 * infers persistence
 * Officer agreed that, in the context of the G20, he was to
intercept people, get identity

*Lunch Break *

* There doesn't seem to be an explicit request for Byron to stand in
front of the police car on record
* Flashing lights are on the back. Byron may not have seen them
(prosecution argues did not, Defense may have)
* Prosecution: They were already aware of Byron's online activity and
could have pursued the investigation without Byron's identity.
* Judge: That isn't clear from the ITOs. The second one's language
seems to suggest otherwise.


Day ends early. Judge will go over stuff.
