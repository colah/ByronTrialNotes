Byron's Trial, Day 15 (week 4)
==============================

Defense:

* There will be no arguments about the continuity of data (from the computers) from arrest to June 26th, but there are concerns about the interpretation and extraction of the data...
* Evidence heard about computer search has no bearing on severability issues, only manner of search.
* My friend now concedes that there was a breach of section 9...
* Crown: To clarify, since the search of the computer was outside the time frame, there's a breach of 8...
* Judge: I'm not sure that position is consistent... Can't you analyze a bloody shirt after you seize it?
* Crown: Given Jones makes it clear that the Crown can no longer argue that even if the computer was seized under 498, a warrant is needed to search the computer.
* While searching computers may be technologically different, it is effectively the same as searching a physical place, and is handled under the code. "Building, receptical..." 487(2)(1) ...
* There's an argument that if you make an image of the harddrive your violating the warrant by taking all that data. One interpretation is that such images may be made with the consent of a Justice for data integrity, but must be sealed when the investigation is done.
* A two part warrant, where the computer is seized and then a second search occurs...
* Judge: And the keywords would have prior judicial authorization?
  * For example.
* The position that a computer is like a place is supported by Jones.
* Judge: Did you say a computer was a place?
* A notional place. That the language used in Jones, but I submit a receptical makes more sense in the context of the Code.
* Justice Blair uses different language.
* He also talks about the protection of privacy... "Territorial privacy, varying degrees of protection... intimacy of the place... and informational privacy..." 
* Search of informational content is very different from physical search.
* Informational privacy is particularity strong in consideration of a personal computer, as seen in Moreli. "It's difficult to imagine a search more invasive, extensive or intrusive than the search of one's personal computer." -- the files which "are required to reasonably accomplish the authorized search"
* The courts must look to the balancing of privacy and need for law enforcement. 
* For example, the perfect search in wiretapping would be to listen to all phone calls, but that's not the balance that's been found.
* Precedent: "We do not accept the Crown's theory of the Computer as a indivisible object"
* "The police are entitled to open those files or folders, at least in a cursory manner, to determine if they ..."
* Two stages: At the search stage, the officers must conduct themselves reasonably and within the warrant. 
* Jones precedent: They should only look at files that seem relevant.
* Mr. Sonne's harddrive was gone through fully by two different officers. 
* Judge: I don't know about two.
* Corporal Lee clearly did an extensive search, even if we don't have testimony ...
* Judge: It seems like it makes sense for a analyst to do a broad search and have someone else look over it later.
* I'd submit that it's the flip side of that... Someone who doesn't know the details would prevent a pretext search.
* searching and seizing are very separate issues.
* Plain view requires inadvertent discovery. 
* Judge: Is it the Crown's position that the computer was seized under the warrant?
  * Prosecution: No, it was seized under 489, plain view.
* There's no ruling if 489 and plain view are the exact same thing. 
  * Judge: Are you saying this is another position where there isn't case law and I'm going to have to rule?
* Plain view isn't a way of circumventing the warrant.
* In this case, in the second warrant, they knew there were computer and seized records specifically.
  * Seizing a computer after that under plain view is circumventing them warrant.
* As in a search for records, when authorized for a specific file, you can't take the whole filing cabinet under plain view.
* If the whole image is going to be seized, it should be sealed except for the search.
* Precedent: cellphone seized on arrest, but it a warrant is needed to search its contents
* ...
* "It's not just a data storage device, it's a personal data storage device"
* "If the police wished to search the Treo, they should have got a warrant."
* ...
* Manaquis claimed the computers were seized under the warrant, though he references plain view. In his cross, he clarified the warrant.
* Judge: As I recall, he was clear that he seized it under the warrant.
* My friend is going to argue based on 489, but its clear that he didn't know about it. While not knowing the number is insignificance, the fact that he didn't the test is problematic.
* I submit that since he didn't see the computer being seized under 489 

(Break)

* [Precedents that don't connect plain view and 489]
* The factual basis on which Maniquis' linking of computers to the crimes doesn't meet probable ground.
  * He argued on the basis of social media
  * He agreed that the content wasn't hosted on the computer.
  * He had no reason to believe that a particular computer
* Judge: You need to know which computer? It isn't enough to know that one of the ones at the house?
* They might not be able to do it based on IP address, but certain tests, or at most a cursory search, could locate the appropriate ones.
* Judge: Do we have any evidence about IP addresses in this case? Could the Crown have got that?
* There's no evidence in this case, but it could have been done
* Manquis evidence was that the computers, collectively, could contain evidence. He certainly didn't reach the point that any particular computer did.

* And they had no lawful grounds to search the computers.
* You can't search something under a warrant seized unlawfully under it.
* Crown: Had they searched within the time frame, it would be fine under the warrant.
* Information, once it's out, is hard to control. ... extra caution is needed with over seizure.

* Data seized was inappropriate. Nothing that deals with home ownership. There's a few documents that might be seized on explosive concerns, and a few ...
* The search terms provided by Oullet, on its face, require a broader warrant.
* I submit that they took a very casual approach to the warrant.
* Judge: Casual? Broad, but...
* Casual in how he passes over the use of the term Dealers, despite having concerns.
* Judge: Who was he supposed to go to? The issuing justice?
* Or the Crown.
* He didn't think the term production of 
* Failure to use automated file search (to protect privacy). Oullet said he needed to look at every file because it could have been disguised, but we later heard that ncase can automate this.
* He went over more than 3000 emails. This could have been automated. 
* If one used a keyword search first the search would have a much smaller scope.
* The search Oullet had conducted was not the one authorized by the warrant.
* Judge: If you were searching two attached houses for a gun, and broaden the scope to the second one, and then try to apply the warrant to it...
* His arguments that he had reasonable and probable to believe communications might be with coconspirators is problematic.
* Judge: To clarify, your making this argument for if the Crown gets over the overly broad search issues.
* Yes

* Judge: Is there a tainting issue with the waveguide?

* There's a pattern of problems with the computer. The serious of state conduct is significant. It's not an isolated mistake. Systematic failure, and severely violates the charter interests of Mr. Sonne. Regarding the impact on society... [discuss dropped charges]

* He's just guessing what evidence is and what its significance

Prosecution:

* The search of the contents of the computer. I agree that we are in 24(2) territory, because we were outside the time constraint. That's as technical an error as can be. This is a problem of the unusual way the warrant was made.
* It wasn't seized under the warrant, but it was lawfully seized in other ways. And the place something was seized can't prejudice... 
* This timing issue is such a trivial issue that it warrants no remedy whatsoever.
* My friend made a number of points like minimization. These are things my friend would like to see in the law, and if Jones goes to the Supreme Court, it may be. But presently...
* Judge: If Corporal Lee searched the whole computer was searched, that's a section 8 breach.
* If you find it to not be justified...
* Each officer in a chain of doing something requiring reasonable grounds does not necessarily need to have probable grounds.
* Judge: I'm aware of that. It's not at question here.
* Regarding Jones: 
  * The facts of Jones are different and important. He was accused of fraud around selling a motorcycle. They were looking for evidence of that, searched for pictures of the motorcycle, came across child pornography, and continued on to ...
  * In our case, he felt he needed to look at all types of files. Even without conspiracy, he said that.
  * Judge: What do I do about the fact that he wasn't restricting his search... It's records relevant to the production of explosives... He was very broad... 
  * That's where I disagree. It's been suggested that the warrant tells not only what to look for, but how to look for it... That's patently ridiculous.
  * Judge: Why? 
  * ...
  * Judge: So you're saying that they could search for anything that might help them prove the charge?
  * Surely an officer must feel free to use his knowledge of the case...
  * Judge: That's not what I'm having trouble with. They have went beyond the scope.
  * ...
  * Judge: So you're saying that evidence of ideology and such is... 
  * "The police are allowed to exercise some ingenuity. It's not against the constitution for the Police to be creative."
  * 'Will afford evidence', my friend seems to think that it needs to be conclusive of guilt.
  * Judge: That's not what I took. More a narrow interpretation of 'production of explosives'. ... He's saying the warrant should have been broader.
  * "Intention to use a device is evidence that bears upon the production of explosives" 
* My friend may have given an impression that the police are more limited 
* Precedent: "This is not because the warrant was to broad, but because the warrant was properly limited..."
* Judge: You're saying that I can go from evidence of the production of explosives to evidence relevant to the production of explosives.
* "Imagine if we had discovered that a bomb attack on Toronto was imminent"
* Judge: If you're going to search beyond the production of explosives, it seems to me that that should have been in the warrant. 
* My friend is arguing only 
* "Proof of evidence for intent that is circumstantial evidence of production of explosives is covered by the warrant"
* Judge: But I think you're saying more than that.
* Judge: I'm not talking about 
* Judge: I guess your argument is that evidence of Anarchy is evidence of intent to blow things up... But not all anarchists blow things up.
* Judge: It's about how you connect it back...
* Judge: You're saying that it can be intent, that it can be circumstantial... ?
* Well, it doesn't have to be ...
* To the extent that the court agrees with me that the Oullet...
* ...
* Judge: It's not just what you can look at but what you're looking for.
* But in our case, the ..., 
* Judge: You're saying 'related to the production of explosives' but what you actually mean is related to the charges listed in the warrant....
* [starts talking about case law in the US]
* ...
* Given what he knew, and given the warrant, there was no type of file he could exclude from a search. 
* We're in 24(2) territory. I fully acknowledge that.
* My friend ultimately has the onus of proving that evidence should be excluded.
* Oullet predates Jones. Given that, the extent to which he was 
* Oullet approached this in good faith, not at all cavalier, and was considerate of Mr. Sonne's Charter Rights.
* Given that he got through the amount of material, we can draw the inference that he was only glancing at most.
* He wasn't watching every movie to see if there's frames embedded that might yeild evidence of an offense. 
* Judge: And that's the problem: Might yield evidence.
* "There's nothing wrong with a police officer looking at those terms and being a bit creative, and I don't mean creative in the pejorative sense."
* He's taking the warrant 
* In Jones we're dealing with a case that is easily delimited, it is the facts of our case that lead to the need to seek out circumstantial evidence, to follow a reasonable chain of logic 
*If you're looking for a truck (as per the warrant) and it occurs to you to check a drawer for keys, I submit that an officer has license to be creative in that way.

* (During nt as issues that the  break) Court reporter "get it for the record, you might need it... If the court reporter misses it it's gone into the ether."

* Even assuming a narrow interpretation, it remains the case that the warrant justifies the search of every type of file on the computer: documents, photographs, images, videos
* Either way we end up with lawful seizures, whether they were justified in searching for everything in a broader, creative way as I submit or via plain view in the course of a narrower search.
* The officer has a preemptively valid court order and good intentions when faced with a difficult case that clearly involves circumstantial evidence
* DeBeau: an officer is entitled to assume reasonable grounds on the basis of another officer's finding of reasonable grounds
*Lee and Letch were doing a cursory search, they were acting on Oulette's direction
*24-2: I suggest that this is not a serious case of state misconduct, Dave Ouellette was acting in good faith with what he thought was a valid warrant, even it is ruled that in his creative dischargement of his duties he stepped over the line it is only by a little
*There is no type of file issue here, therefore it cannot result in exclusion.
* If this (exampled of files brought to Ouellette by defense) is as bad as it got then Ouellette was on the right track eg: twitter file defense took officer through, officer response: establishes link between TorontoGoat and Byron Sonne
* "Ouellette had a reasonable explanation for why he identified certain things"
* Ouellette on various emails: I say Ouellette had a response that put him within the terms of the warrant as it stood at the time, and even if he wasn't it's not like he was completely off the wall
* He is acting before Jones ever even came out, and if he is not in total compliance with Jones he's in substantive compliance with Jones
* Re. State conduct: The warrant was poorly drafted, I think that the police did their best although the warrant handicapped them in certain respects. These officers were trying to do their jobs, they were working 
*2d grant factor: Impact on charter protected interests of the accuses, the interests of the accused with respect to computer were very high, notwithstanding there is no type of file issue here, the plain view 
*With slightly better drafting the police could have done everything they did here, this is only a problem because of poor drafting
*Circumstantial case: with every circumstantial piece that is removed the case weakens, if the evidence is allowed in Jones it should be allowed here.
*His decision to seize computers: based of the fact that it was in plain view. He also said he believed the warrant permitted the seizure of the computer. He believed that if he can search the contents of the receptacle then he can seize the receptacle 
*"I'm not trying to be cute here but..." It is the warrant that gives the authority to be on the premisis to make the plain view observation, so in some way he was right that it was on the authority of the warrant that he seized the computer
*He believed he had reasonable and probable grounds to seize what he seized
*Miller, court of appeal:... Can I finish tomorrow?
*Scheduling... snore
