Byron's Trial, Verdict
=======================


* 64 people: 8 obvious journalists, 2 lawyers that are colleagues of Byron's lawyers, about 14 high school students

* Judge: I have a decision that will go on the record for appeal. I'm going to read a portion right now.

* Accompanied by two documents.

* The main portion I' skipping, beside law, is a summary of the evidence.

* Byron Sonne came to the attention of police ...

* Found his flickr and twitter account including pictures of police and the American embassy. Older pictures seem to have included a potato cannon... A modified microwave that the police believed could be used to interfere with communications... 

* Arrested, executed warrant and searched house. During the search they found a workshop in the basement including chemicals in labeled jars and electrolysis cell... No expectation of finding chemicals. New warrant the next day.

* Mr. Sonne stands charged with possessing six chemicals or the ingredients to make them: TATP, HDN, ... Also one count of counselling people unknown to commit mischief not committed.

* Mr. Sonne pleaded not guilty and chose child by Judge.

* THe main issues are chemicals ... and his intent...

* What is an explosive substance?

* No explosive substances found. But there was no dispute with one exception that he had ingredients to make them.

* It is the theory of the crown that he accumulated chemicals... and then started making substantial amounts of potassium chlorate. His obsession with the G20 brought him to attention and so he made an alabi of rocketry. The Crown takes the possession that he did not have a genuine motive... relating to hacklab chats, joining CAR, etc... Ms. Nadaeu took the position that there was no other reasonable explanation...

* Defense suggested to reasons. Firstly, that there were innocent reasons for chemistry. He was presented as a layered person with many reasons... It is submitted that if Mr. Sonne needed an alibi he would not have .. used his credit card. Secondly, he intended to test the system. This submission mainly relied on an email exchange with Kate Milbery... Since Mr. Sonne is presumed innocent, it must being considering if this explains the evidence. This is consistent with his involvement with hacklab, the Toronto security klatch...

* The Crown's response is that, if he was... he wouldn't have actually bought them or taken them out of their packaging.

* There is no dispute about Byron's tweets and ...

* I turn to my analysis of evidence and ...

* I have the evidence of Mr. Supinski and the statements of Mr. Sonne to the police, and his blog. Do the principels of WD apply? .... I've determined that the case that decides is a recent... "What I take from a review is that... WD applies not only ... but as a general principle. The trial judge must relate the idea of reasonable doubt to testimony... In that event..." So the principles of WD apply. If any of the evidence leaves me with a reasonable doubt...

* There was no opportunity for crossexamination of these statements.

* "If the Crown provides a statement of the accused, exculpatory parts must be included..." Is it appropriate to tell a jury "a part of a statement that ... where as an exculpatory statement has less weight..." They shouldn't, but it is an accurate statement of law.

* Much of the things he said were backed up by evidence. The question is the weight I should give to his answer.

* I can see his demeanor in the video. It's important to consider what he knew at this point about the case...

* Said "police were trying to nail him to the wall"...

* Crown says Mr. Sonne wasn't that concerned about arrest or search... He mumbles on video about why...

* The fact that he was calm could just mean that he knew he wasn't making explosives.

* Bui covered a lot of ground and he answered most questions.

* Crown points out that Mr. Sonne wasn't forthcoming with some information... This is expected with someone that is intelligent. But he was honest in all answers and this is reasonable a person in his position...

* Mr. Sonne wasn't completely forth right with magnetron, his statements on his blog are a bit difference...

* There were points that he could have volunteered more information. But that isn't a reasonable expectation of him.

* In considering whether his interests... whether other things he said are true.

* He talks about a lot of interests that are backed by evidence and found to be true.

* There was also things Mr. Sonne told the police many things he couldn't have expected the police to know about. Electrolysis cell, launchers, launcher could hurth someone if misused, copper crystal... he gave this information despite the fact he believed a charge might relate to the launcher. All of it seems to be true.

* When asked about the detonator, Mr. Sonne said that he didn't, even when the Crown said a thermocouple is.

* Mr. Sonne was very fair in many of his answers. For example when Detective Bui suggested police might be concerned, but that he had no intent to cause fear...

* As such, I can place some weight on his statements and find them to be true.

* The chats and emails are genuine.

* I must consider the Crown's position that this was an alabi.

* Mr. Supinski was clearly concerned about protecting Mr. Sonne. While it is not suggested he was dishonest, he was very defensive and may have streched the... In any event, he really didn't add much to the chats... While he is clearly interested in rocketry, he didn't convince me that he and Mr. Sonne shared the interest before May 20...

* The Defense concedes that Mr. Sonne possessed the chemicals and that some of the chemicals could be assembled into an explosive. But that isn't possession of explosives unless he intended to assemble them.

* The parties agree that, none of the chemicals were explosives, but the Crown relies that on the expanded definition... The Crown has advanced a very broad definition. There's very little precedent. While the law seems to suggest a broad defintion, the fact that it includes any chemicals that can be used to make one, but it is a circular definition.

* The Crown suggests the following definition from Webster's definition: "A sustenance that on heat, impact... under goes rapid combustion and releases energy."

* The Defense disagrees, noting it would include matches. They prefer the definition ...

* In the case... Because the police couldn't make the replica explode but just started a fire...

* The Crown took the posision that a rocket engine was... but when pressed adimitted that if he was making solely rockets that would not be a crime.

* The Crown aslo pointed out... that he knew he needed a manufacturing license and had seen law which included rockets and fireworks...

* The Defense distinguishes between a propellant and an explosive.

* In my view the defintion that the Defense gives is too narrow and the Crown is too broad.

* Part of the reason the ... case was over turned was...

* The Crown's definition is also clearly too broad, since it would catch a aresol can.

* Considering the evidence of Dr. Anderson, definition: "A chemical that is intended to explode and cause damage." This excludes non-weaponized rockets and fireworks. Such people may still be violating regulations...

* An explosive must include a device... There is a fine distinction between possessing a device intended to explode and the accused intending to cause it to explode.

* The question is if the Crown has proved that Mr. Sonne intended to assemble it. There is no confession or statement of intent...

* The Crown points to inferences, and the Defense makes alternate ones.

* If any of the inferences can be made that he would be innocent, he must be found innocent.

* Before turning to the specific explosive substances individually... I will consider them as a whole.

* This analysis must be done with the onus on the Crown...

* I've already agreed that Mr. Sonne was legitimately interested in security, and would have wanted to keep an explosive. While there is evidence that Mr. Sonne knew how to make explosives, and no evidence that he intended to break the law at the G20, or that any negative feelings he had were strong enough to break the law.

* The most problematic is count ... relating to potassium chlorate or ... since there were large amounts. He had also uploaded "Ragner's guide to home and recreational explosives.."

* The Crown notes that she doesn't have to prove that Mr. Sonne intended to use an explosive. Just that he intended to make one.

* Looking to the evidence, I agree with Mr. DiLuca, that if someone wanted to make an explosive you wouldn't expect them to make six different explosives. Nor is it suprising that one has draino in their garage.

* The filtration device was likely for making potassium chlorate, and the hot plate for making crystals. This makes it less likely that he bought it for the purposes of making explosives.

* Stripping away the chemicals that one expects to find in the garage of someone with a broad range of evidence, there is potassium permangenate, possible the hexaine tablets...

* The Crown argues that we don't know Ms. Milbery is actually a doctoral student. That doesn't matter, only the truth of what Mr. Sonne says.

* Mr. DiLuca also relies on the "Tickling the Dragon" thread. I accept this email as another example of Mr. Sonne want to push the limits, consistent with him testing the system.

* I have no further evidence that he was testing the system. He was not asked.

* The Crown suggests that the email to Ms. Milbery could be the scope that got stopped at the border. But this doesn't match what he says in the email.

* I agree that there was no reason to say that he was testing the system if he wasn't.

* The Crown notes that, as an intelligent person, Mr. Sonne wouldn't test the system if he didn't have something set up to prove it when he caught attention. That he wouldn't have actually bought them, or got rid of the chemicals...

* It is strange that Mr. Sonne didn't document this, unlike other things he documented on his blog. 

* There is merit in Ms. Nadaeu that Mr. Sonne appeared to be knowledgeable about the relevant sections of the Criminal Code.

* When Detective Bui asked about... This shows that he was alive to the issue.

* While I don't find this part of the statement not consistent with the Defense theory, I don't believe it suggests... More likely, he intended to convey...

* If he believed everything he was doing is legal, he wouldn't need an alabi. 

* It is strange that everything was visible and labeled under his desk, if he intended them for a nefarious purpose.

* ... Begs the question of why Mr. Sonne took pictures of police. He knew he was getting attention when he was detained. Why would someone doing something nefarious draw that attention?

* Dr. Anderson also tried to buy hydrogen peroxide and a colleague...

* Right after the underwear bomber, he tried to order, under his name and with his credit card, potassium permagegante, from two locations from the US and when that failed from a local store.

* Mr. Sonne is an intelligent man... doing this would have been foolhardy to the extreme. Especially since he discussed how to do things so that they couldn't be traced to him in his chats. And the security culture handbook shows that he knew the importance of doing things in secret if it is illegal... So it appears he was trying to test the system and raise flags.

* The defense suggested that Mr. Sonne might buy chemicals to test the system and then use the legitimately.

* The Defense suggests that he could have bought them in small contents to demonstrate that it was possible fo this presentation... But that is different than what he says to Detective Bui.

* Mr. Sonne was being public and if he intended to make a bomb...

* It is concerning some the stuff he puts on the Internet, including US nuclear sites. ... this would be consistent with Mr. Sonne's extreme version of exercising his rights. It wouldn't make sense it he intended to make a bomb.

* Ms. Nadaue also suggests that it doesn't make sense, if he was using them legitimately, he woudln't have taken volatile chemicals into his neighborhood. He had become concerned about the amount of potassium chlorate he had and buried it in his back yard.

* While I haven't decided on the legitimacy of his concern in his statement about the safety of his neighbors, but I have found that he cared deeply about his wife. But making a bomb would have inherent risks.

* While the Crown doesn't need to show that he was going to ..

* Regarding TATP. There is no dispute that it is an explosive. But this charge can be quickly disposed of because the crown did not prove that there was acetone. The Crown suggested that, because there was a container labeled acetone, but the authority she found... she attempts to extend them beyond their intended purpose. The fact that they are labeled some evidence, but I don't know how much if any was in them, or if it would have been suitable, or it could have been something else. One was labeled "used acetone".

* But I'll consider the evidence... While I don't know why Hydrogen Peroxide was in the lab rather than the garage, it appears to have been a liquid fertilizer. I can not find that it was intended for this purpose rather than its intended comercial use.

* The acids were for clearing drains or cleaning. Even if these belong to Mr. Sonne. 

* The Crown has not proven, beyond a reasonable doubt charge 1.

* Charge 2. There was no citric acid, though that is the standard chemical and can easily be bought. The other acids could have been used, but I've already addressed other uses. I've also addressed hydrogen peroxide.

* Mr. Sonne suggested that he used them for their intended purpose of camping implicitly in his statement.

* It seems most likely that they were in with the camping supplies. While it significant that he labeled them "hexamine" but he also used "fuel tablets"

* Ms. Nadaue suggested that he wouldn't have bought fuel tablets at that time, but he seems to be very organized and preparing for camping.

* The jars would be a more efficient way of moving the tablets to the cottage and they would be water tight. 

* I find a reasonable inference that he had them for their intended uses, particularly starting camp fires.

* Turning to count 3. The Crown must find that he intended to make Urea Nitrate and use it in making an explosive. There is no doubt that he had urea, but no nitric acid was found.

* He did get a quote for nitric acid, and it is significant that he did it at the same time of the potassium permangenate.

* It is significant that there are other chemicals that could make nitric acid, but he didn't have the appropriate apparatus. This can being avoided, but it raises a doubt. He could have easily acquired the apparatus needed.

* I've already found that Mr. Sonne had a legitimate interest in gardening. He gave an explanation of why he had multiple fertilizers in his possesion. 

* I find a reasonable inference that what he told Detective Bui was true and the Crown has not proved this for count 3.

* Count 3 also involves making HDN. This also required nitric acid, which I have addressed. Given that I already found other reasonable uses for the chemicals.

* Reasonable doubt on count 3.

* Regarding to count 4.

* A rocket engine is not an explosive if its use...

* Potassium chlorate can be turned into an explosive if it is combined with sugar.

* There is no suggestion that purchasing the necessary chemicals to make potassium chlorate would raise flags.

* He had almost 3kg of potassium chlorate in his possession, 1 in his lab and 2 in his back yard.

* This raises serious questions, but it clearly has use in making rocket fuel...

* Most the fuels that could be used with potassium chlorate are in anyone's home. 

* There was also aluminimum. That was discussed in the hacklab chat for combination with an epoxy.

* There were three electrolysis cell. It sounds like the largest one didn't work. I find that the largest wasn't evidence that he was ramping up production.

* The fact that Mr. Sonne tried three different ones suggest time, but there would not be much in th expenses...

* The Crown has suggested that it rocketry was an elaborate alibi.

* No rockets found at the house. But that wasn't being searched for. But it is reasonable to infer that, had rockets were found, they would have been seized given that they were looking for explosives.

* The Crown suggests that he wouldn't start with fuel if he was designing the rocket.

* I would not conclude that it is unreasonable for someone like Mr. Sonne making the rocket fuel first.

* First evidence of rocketry in his bookmarks...

* Then May second.

* Both of these related to making chlorates. This raises the question of whether he doing it for other reasons...

* The lack of evidence about making a rocket is at odds with what I would have expected. All of this is odd. This supports the Crown's theory Mr. Sonne that it was an elaborate...

* Mr. Sonne was trying to buy more...

* On May 29th he posted on hacklab chat... He was stopping making potassium chlorate and going to bury a magazine... This is at odds with another...

* While I'm troubled by the inconsistencies, the fact remains that he publicly said he had made a lot and was getting rid of it.

* Based on the evidence, it is as likely that he was done making chlorate as that he was going to make another.

* I find a reasonable inference that he had in fact stopped.

* He accurately described the way he was maing them. 

* After the pail was found, the Crown suggested...

* The Defense argues that it was unreasonable to expect him to tell the police about the pail and tha expecting it would violate his right to silence.

* If, as the Crown says, this was an elaborate ploy, why would he talk about it publicly. Mr. Sonne was conscious of the possibility that someone might be listening.

* This is strong evidence against him using it for something nefarious.

* While I don't find that there was a detailed evidence of an agreement of Mr. Sonne and Mr. Supinski. There is, however, evidence that they were going to make a presentation together.

* Talk about how to press fuel on the hacklab chat, suggest a car jack and then bought it.

* There is no evidence that explosives need to be pressed but there is evdience that he needs it to make a rocket engine.

* This goes well beyond what one needed for an alabi.

* The Crown notes that it is strange that Mr. Sonne asked about CAR on the hacklab chat, rather than googling, or phoning Mr. Supinski. ...

* I agree that it is strange... But it is possible that Mr. Sonne may not have paid much attention to them until he got to the point where he wanted to make rocket engines...

* Emails asking about making rocket fuels to CAR and MNR. It seems odd, if he had a nefarious purpose, that he would write to Natural Resources Canada.

* Posting chats like this don't seem to be the logical way to make an alibi.

* Mr. Sonne's stated purpose was to send up a camera.

* Dr. Anderson's evidence is that the amount of rocket fuel would be for a very large rocket or many...

* I've also considered whether Mr. Sonne was in violation of any regulatory offense. He is not charged with this, but it speaks to whether he was trying to stay on the right side of the law.

* He had not actually started making rocket fuel. ... No evidence that he was in violation to any provincial regulatory offense.

* The Crown also pointed out that, despite the warning, Mr. Sonne had bought potassium chloride. But it would only be an offense to make the rocket fuel. Potassium chlorate possession is not an offense.

* All this would be a very elaborate alabi.

* There is a lot of evidence that he was legitimatly interested, from the hacklab chats, chemicals he had, and statement to Detective Bui.

* For all these reasons, I find that a reasonable inference can be drawn that potassium chlorate was for rockets.

* So he is not guilty of count 4 here.

* Count 4 also includes amonium nitrate...

* The Defense suggests that he had...

* That would be very expensive fertilizer.

* Amonium nitrate is a regulated chemical. This corroborates what Mr. Sonne said.

* Although almost 2.5kg seems like a lot, I don't know that it was unreasonable relative to the size of a garden he may have used.

* Mr. Sonne told Detective Bui that he was going to use different fertilizers and see how plants responded.

* Mr. Sonne discussing all of this in the hacklab chat is strange if he had nefarious intent.

* I am not satasfied that he had them for use as an explosive.

* Not guilty of count 4.

* Count 5 involves counseling mischief not committed.

* Counseling means "actively inducing" (in ..). Discussion of difference between describing a criminal offense and a inducement of a criniaml offense.

* Deliberate encouragement does not include the mens rea... The dual mesn rea should not be used.

* The actis rea for counseling shall be found where the communication can be seen as actively inducing...

* So my finding that he didn't intend to cause harm is not relevant here.

* Would a reasonable person, viewing the tweets objectively, see it as an invitation?

* tweets ... points out that he tools could help climb.

* Could be tweets we don't see.

* Ms. Nadeau says that the evidence..

* Ms. Nadeau says that his interest in security is not a legitimate reason. I agree. Mr. Supinsiki said you would only point out...

* There is no tweet or comment that a person actively induce or encourages people to do this.

* As ... "the scope is not limited ... but it must actively attempt to persuade them"

* I find that Mr. Sonne did nothing more than plan a seed.

* It is the position of the Defense that, in any event, that these are an out of context portion of the conversation.

* Given that there could be tweets we don't see, the tweets in context could be very different... so even if they had actively induced, Mr. Sonne would have to be found innocent of this charge.

* Mr. Sonne could you please stand?

* I declare you innocent on all five counts.

(Lawyers stand and shake Byron's hand.)

(Judge talking about grammatical error in decision, which actually wasn't an error, and now rereads the original wording. No actually, the last part should come out...)

* I just want to thank Council for cooperation.

(Judge leaves)

(Lots of clapping and cheering)

* Byron: Now, speaking of discussion of Urea, I need to go to the washroom.
