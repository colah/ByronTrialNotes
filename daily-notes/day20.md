Byron's Trial, Day 20 (Week 5)
==============================

(Judge has sentencing in the morning, so we may start late)

(Judge has obligation to attend an event today between 1 and 2:30)

* Dr. Crawford John Anderson sworn in.
* C: The qualifications of Dr. Anderson is not in question, but I'd like to highlight a few things that are of relevance.
* I Understand you did your Masters and undergraduate degree at ... ?
 * Yes.
* And then your PHD at ... ?
 * Yes.
* Mining for several years?
 * Yes.
* And then army?
 * Yes.
* You have expertise in non-conventional explosives ...?
 * Yes.
* (Lots of roles in military regarding explosives expertise)?
 * (Yes to many, to a few "No, I've turned those over to someone else")
* National representative for ...; ... Director of explosives ... Briefing ... 
 * Yes.
* National point of contact for (several groups relating to explosives)
 * Yes.
* Projects: "Improvised Explosives Assessment Tool" which included (long list of countries).
 * Yes.
* 26 conference proceedings. Presented on "Improvised Homemade Explosive Threats" in Virginia.
 * Yes.
 * If I may comment, TSWG holds a workshop on homemade explosives and we go down and present every year.
* ... Fuel storage 
 * Yes, (explosive safety organization)
* Presented internationally...
 * Yes.
* (Duplicate in resume) I think there was a printing error.
 * No, it was me accidentally copying and pasting
* Five patents
 * Yes, or patent applications.
* (Asks about one)
 * Oh, that's about how we made a foam that looked like shaving cream but was detonable. 
* And you've also had time to be an expert witness in both Canada and the US?
 * Yes.
* J: Counsel, do you have any questions?
 * D: Not until cross.
* J: His expertise are quite broad. You are tendering him as?
 * Organic chemistry, and improvised homemade explosive devices.
* J: I'm prepared to accept those expertise.
* C: Over a year ago, you were contacted by Officer Tam Bui about things they found at the house?
 * Yes, I was provided a number of pictures.
* And you received emails and phone contact from myself and the forensic science report?
 * Yes.
* You never so any of the physical exhibits.
 * No, I didn't not physically see any of the apparatus or chemicals...
* You asked specific questions?
 * Yes.
* And you testified at the Preliminary Inquiry?
 * Yes.
* I think that the easiest way is go through things ...
*
* Can you tell us what TATP stands for?
 * Triacetone Triperoxide
* Ingredients
 * Acetone, Hydrogen Peroxide, and an acid
 * In my experience, it is either sulferic acid or hydrochloric acid. I use hydrochloric acid.
* Were the items necessary to make TATP in the catalog of chemicals seized?
 *
* HTMD
 * Hexamine Triperoxide Di...
* Ingredients
 * Hexamine, hydrogen peroxide, and an acid
* Same acids?
 * The standard procedure involves citric acid, but you can also use hydrochloric acid 
* Meriatic acid?
 * Is the generic name for hydrochloric acid?
* Citric acid can be manufactured?
 * Readily available. You can by it 
* HDA
 * Hexamine ...
 * Hexamine, water to dissolve it, and nitric acid.
* Was nitric acid present?
 * No.
* How do you make it?
 * Potassium nitrate and hydrocholoric acid.
* Is that complicated?
 * No but it requires a distillation apparatus.
* Was there a distillation apparatus?
 * No.
* Now what is urea nitrate?
 * An explosive.
* 
 * Take urea, add nitric acid, and watch the urea nitrate ...
* Was urea in the chemicals in his house?
 * Yes, but not nitric acid.
 * I'd like to comment that you can use ... instead to make nitric acid in the solution
 * Add the hydrocholoric acid, the potassium nitrate and hydrochloric acid will react to give nitric acid in solution, which will then react with the urea to give urea nitrate.
* Based on that, were the chemicals and equipment sufficient to produce ..
 * Yes
* Urea nitrate?
 * Yes 
* ANFO?
 * Amonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil.
 * Blended in the mining industry to give a powerful explosive.
* Amonium nitrate was found?
 * Yes.
* What fuel would be?
 * Any combustible material with lots of carbon
 * Also, any combustible metal, like aluminum... aluminum powder.
* Anything that was found?
 * Many things from the kitchen: Sugar, oil, almond flour.
* C: If I could remind the court...
* J: I recall the almond flour.
* D: Actually, we don't have anything other than Mr. Sonne statement that the almond flour was....
* (Lawyers argue)
* Well the almond flour was just something... Is it an appropriate fuel?
 * Well, a liquid fuel is better because the particles get more intimately coated. But any organic powder basically works, especially if it has a lot of carbon. Sugar is popular, fuel oil.
* Are we talking about a solid or liquid?
 * Most explosives are solid, some are a gas, some pasty...
* How would I detonate it?
 * The two peroxide explosives, are a very sensitive explosives. Very sensitive to friction, impact, heat. A wire run across...
* You'd want to put it together at the last minute if it is that unstable?
 * They're not unstable. (one) would be wanted to store it in a cold place because it has a high vapor pressure, the other is fine as is.
* You'd want to store it in a baggy?
 * You're limited by your imagination for storage?
* How do you store it for explosives?
 * Pipe bombs with metal pipes, vests
 * Often used in improvised detonator. Put a little bit around the filament of a light bulb.
* Detonator...
 * The classic detonator is a small tube, but you can use any small container.
* Were the elements there for making a detonator?
 * There was small containers, nichrom wires, small bulbs...
 * I didn't see any evidence of small metal tube, but I saw inch pipe. That would be a big detonator for a large explosive...
* J: It's important I understand this evidence.... The detonator is a source of heat like a light bulb filament... But then you talk...
 * The detonator is the entire package that delivers the shock to the explosive. So that would be a heat source...
 * TATP in detonator would be set off by the heat, then generates sufficient shock to set off the explosive it is in.
* J: You've said that a classic detonator would be a metal tube, also a small plastic bottle... I don't understand how all of that is combined
 * Perhaps I should explain in a more general fashion. There is a main charge that needs to be set off. Unless it is very sensitive... It takes a shock generated by another explosive to do that. And that explosive can be in the detonator itself...
* J: 
 * For an explosion event to occur, you need an initiation system and a main charge. That initiation is based on a detonator. That detonator is typically based off an explosive that is set off to start the charge that is used in the main explosive.
 * There are many types of explosive, some are cap sensitive...
* J: Cap?
 * A blasting cap, 4 inches long, half an inch to an inch wide. 
 * Sometimes, if your explosive isn't sensitive enough, you have a booster around it that is set off by the detonator...
* C: At the preliminary inquiry you testified that the possibilities for explosives are only limited by your imagination.
* ... You wouldn't see TATP in a detonator for TATP?
* Can electronic detonators be made?
 * You mean a circuit 
 * There were small bulbs found.
 * There was a cellphone. You could use a cellphone as part of the initiation set off.
* In the preliminary inquiry you said there was enough to make an explosive. 
 * It is my opinion that there was more than enough to make an improvised explosive and an improvised explosive device. That is all I can speak to.

( C wants to file Anderson's report from Preliminary Inquiry. D is OK with it as an aid, but wants everything to be testified. C thinks it is an important thing to add to the record... C says they've never seen such an objection before. J thinks that if there's an objection, it needs to be testified. J is going to look up cases while we take a short break. C says Anderson could just read the report. J says it may not be different while D is right. D says it will be clearer if we deal with topic by topic asking questions. J will task law clerk a short research assignment into case law over the break. We will carry on in the meantime.)

* C: At this point, I'd like to go through some exhibits.

* (Photo of garage shelf) Does anything concern you?
 * Two bottles of acetone, one said it is used, but that is one of the ingredients in TATP.
* Other bottle, Tetrahdrofuran?
 * I know what it is. I don't think it is relevant to the production of explosives.
* Methyl hydrate?
 * It's methanol. Again a solvent. It is used for the recrystalization of TATP so you can purify the TATP.
* How does that work?
 * Your first production run isn't pure. So you put it in boiling methanol and then when it cools...
* If you don't purify it, is it explosive?
 * It's more explosive. But it is less stable.
* (Next shelf.)
 * Face shield, dust mask, 
 * Standard use for some types of chemicals. If you were making HTMD which involves an acid, you'd want that or at least a ...
* (Next shelf)
 * Steel wool. You can use if for cleaning, but you can also use a strand for an explosive detonator.
* (Next picture) PVC piping with caps.
 * You could use it for a pipe bomb, though terrorist usually use steel pipe because that would make shrapnel. 
* Because that would hurt more people?
 * Your lethal radius increases?
* If your goal wasn't to hurt people but blow things up?
 * You'd certainly have a reduced radius of lethality.
* (Next pic) Muriatic acid
 * Hydrochloric acid. We've evaluated 
 * Acid for TATP or HTMD or you could use with potassium nitrate...
* You'd use it for cleaning your drains?
 * No, you'd use the draino beside it. You might clean your drive way with it.
 * Draino is sulfuric acid. Good enough for a regent.
* (Picture of pipes)
 * Any of those could be cut down and used for the container of an explosive charge.
* (Thermocouple)
 * Picture and the connector end, and the report noted from the center of forensic science.
 * At the preliminary inquiry I said it was not a detonator but thermocouple. That is further supported by the fact that they found the resistance varying with temperature. It is a thermocouple. You use it to determine temperature.
* So it is plastic pen cap on a ball of wire?
 * No it is two wires soldered together with a special material. You'd hook it up to a multimeter to measure voltage...
 * The cap is a protected cover.
* Could you use the cap as a detonator.
 * Yes. I've seen pens turned into a detonator.
* And would the thermocouple relate to any of these
 * The production of HTMD and ... are temperature sensitive. Temperature control and monitoring are essential. They heat up very quickly.
* (Nichrom wire picture)
 * Nichrom wire is a very good filament to use for detonator.
* Any other use?
 * It has a fixed resistance for length, so you might use it some how...
* Coiled wire is ...
 * I don't see how you would use it in a detonator.
* (Anti-static bag)
 * That is what we use to store TATP and HTMD. They are very sensitive to electro-static discharge.
* J: You mean static electricity?
 * Yes.
* J: Why is that important?
 * You don't want any static electricity to, ah, ruin your day.
* (hot plate and mits)
 * Your hot plate is a 
 * If you're going to dissolve HTMD in methanol, you'd need to heat it up. For safety, you wouldn't put the methanol on the hot plate, but you could boil water and then put the methanol on that.
 * You could also use it for concentrating the hydrogen peroxide.
* Leaping ahead, the hydrogen peroxide was 29%?
 * Actually 26% but says it is 29%.
 * Sufficient for TATP or HTMD
 * To make another explosive, for example concentrated mixed with an organic, like pepper or cumin, you'd need a much higher concentration. You would do that by boiling the water off.
* It's a bleach?
 * Yes, but your standard bleach is based on a different chemical 
* Is that the kind of bleach you use for laundry?
  * It's the sort of bleach you use if you want to look blond. (Prosecutor is blond)
  * (Discussion of him trying to by it from hair dressers; they didn't sell it and ran him out even faster once he said he was from the government)

(Break)

* (Lab desk) Could you describe what
 * Large filtration funnel, a Büchner funnel.
 * A plastic container with a hole cut in the top
 * Tubing leading to a small flask that is clamped to the stand.
 * Vacuum filtration apparatus.
 * Vacuum pump.
 * This would be used to filter material. Get a powder out of a liquid.
 * It second purpose, and this a good chemistry practice, the small task attached to the stand (Erlenmeyer flask)...
 * Could filter TATP or HTMD crystals from the liquid.
* (vacuum pump) Is this a common house hold item?
 * I don't believe so.
* Without this device could you make the explosives?
 * Yes. You could use a coffee filter. It just takes quite a bit longer.
* (23h, top shelf of cabinet) 
 * Both filtration papers, to be used in a Büchner funnel type setup.
 * In the plastic bag we have coffee filters.
* That's the process you referred to earlier?
 * Or if you had a Büchner filter of the right size.
* What else?
  * Corks and petri dishes, not relevant.
  * Hydrometer, for measuring the density of the liquid. You might use it to check the strength of the peroxide liquid.
* Ordinary uses?
  * At one point, you would have used it in maintaining your car battery. No longer necessary.
  * But that brings us to the fact that it could be used with sulfuric acid.
* (next picture)
 * Sealants and glues. No real relevance to explosives.
* (Next picture)
 * Soldering gun and kit associated with.
 * You'd use this in constructing any electronic circuits for controlling when a detonator went off.
* (next picture)
 * Flexible tubing could be used for venting...
 * Cheese grater was probably used to produce shaved wax.
* (next picture) Shelf by the fridge
* Camp stove and fuel canisters.
 * This is the first time I've seen this, though I've seen similar things in barbecues.
* Could you use this similar to the hotplate.
 * You could, but you have an open flame and are working with flammable solvents.
* Are you aware of using hexamine fuel tablets on a stove like this?
 * No, it's a gas stove.
* (Next pictures) Are these candles relevant
 * Not really. It could be a source of wax which could be used in some ...
* (next picture) What are these?
 * Power supplies to the left and solenoid.
* How would that be relevant?
 * Only if you were trying to make a physical triggering mechanism.
 * Like a physical switch to the device.
* (next picture labeled Hexamine Fuel Tablets)
* (next picture container of fuel tablets open)
* You have a report identifying it has hexamine.
 * Yes.
* And it is a fuel for camping.
 * Yes, that's how we get it when we make HTMD.
* Do they come in containers like this?
 * No, cardboard boxes.
* How pure are these?
 * In the brands we've tested, they're essentially pure hexamine.
* Any other household uses?
 * Maybe starting a fire in a fire place. You'd only use one or two tablets.
* (next picture) Amonium nitrate
 * It's tricky to get now because it is regulated -- sellers have to do due diligence regarding who they sell it to.
 * It's in cold packs.
* 2461 grams. Is that a lot?
 * To me a lot is a ton, from the mining industry.
* Cold packs?
 * You'd need to buy a lot.
* Are there other sources?
 * We're about to do a study on that!
* (next picture) Sulfamic Acid. What is that?
 * I hadn't heard of it before this case. I don't think it is related. It is used to clean metal surfaces.
* (next picture KMnO₄) What is this?
 * Potassium Permangenate
* Is that a regulated substance?
 * Not right now.
* Why do you say that?
 * It's on the screen as something to regulate...
* Why?
 * It has the interesting ability that if you add something with alcohol groups there's a small induction time and they burn.
* Has it been used in homemade explosives?
 * Yes. It can be used to chemically initiate the primary explosive. This is different from electrical igniter.
 * This was used in the September 25th attack in 2009, the underwear bomber.
* No metal involved?
 * Yes. There's no metal wires so it won't be picked up with standard security procedures.
* (next picture) KNO₃
* Are there any other uses?
 * It can be used as a fertilizer on its own, pyrotechnic, food preservative, stump remover.
* Back to potasium permanganate, are there otehr uses?
 * Tanning hides, swimming pool....
* (next picture) Aluminum powder.
* You mentioned it earlier as something you could mix in an explosive
* Are there any house hold uses?
 * Not that I'm aware.
* (next picture) Iron Oxide 
 * You could use it to make thermite with the aluminum oxide.
* Flashbangs?
 * I don't know if it would be in one.
* House hold uses?
 * Not that I know of.
* (next picture) Zink Oxide.
 * Main thing I've seen it for is to make smoke in pyrotechnics
* J: What do you mean pyrotechnics?
 * Something that burns rather than detonates. Like fireworks.
* C: Something with a lot of show... Would that be fare?
 * Yes.
* (next picture) Hexachloro ethane
 * Also used in pyrotechnics.
* (next picture) Charcoal. 
* It's a powder.
* Is that something that is purchased in that form?
 * As activated charcoal.
* What would you use it for?
 * Filtration, like filtering water.
 * From an energetics perspective, it is an excellent source of carbon.
* (next picture) Dextrin. 
 * Used to thicken things.
 * Used to make glue.
 * Made from a starch, so you could use it as a fuel.
* (next picture) KCl
 * Potassium Chloride is something that you could start with to make...
* (next picture) Sterine
 * A triglycerin. You use it to make soap and candles. I don't know why it would be germane to this.
* (next picture) K₂SiO₃
 * I think it is a drying agent...
 * Ah, here we go. It's been identified as potassium silicate. It can be used as a drying agent.
* (next picture) CuSO₄, what is this used for?
 * Nothing with explosives, but you can use it to make beautiful blue crystals. There appears to be containers of that in the lab.
* (next picture) Urea.
 * Fertilizer, but can be used into ...
* (next picture) NaHCO₃
 * For PH control
 * A acid has a PH below seven, base higher.
 * Some recipes of TATP call for a wash in it...
* House hold uses?
 * Baking soda...
* (next picture) Wax shavings. What would you use it for?
 * It would be inefficient, but you could use it as a fuel source.
 * There are recipes that involve it.
* (next picture) PVC and ABS shavings.
 * PVC is Polyvinyl Chloride
 * ABS is Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene... One doesn't usually use the full name.
 * They're plastics. 
 * You could use it as a fuel, not so much PVC because of chlorine.
 * It isn't really fine enough.
 * I'm not familiar with any 
* (next picture) Red die.
 * Not a clue
* (next picture) KOH
 * Apparently, while it was labeled KOH but it did not test for Potassium Hydroxide. 
 * It was Potassium Carbonate Hydrate
 * Could be used as a drying agent.
 * In a PH buffer system.
 * Certainly isn't necessary for any of the types of HTMD that could have been produced here.
* (next picture) TI-MMO, Identified as a metal plate...
 * Titaium by itself isn't that useful, but with certain metal oxides on the surfaces it is a good cathode in an electrochemical cell.
 * For making Potassium Ch... 
* Moving on to the furnace room area.
* (next picture) 
 * That is your electrochemical cell.
* Explain, in simple terms, what it is...
 * It uses an electrical current to trigger a reaction a the cathode or anode.
 * In the case of potassium chloride. You have potassium ions and cholrine ions, and they recombine get potassium chlorate. If you use Sodium Chloride, table salt, you get sodium chlorate. Oxygen from the water.
* So you use it to make chlorates?
 * Could.
* 
  * potassium chlorate was found on the scene.
* Can you buy potassium chlorate?
 * It's restricted in higher...
* What other uses?
 * It's used in rocket motors.
 * Canada bans its use in fire works.
* J: Was it found in the cell?
 * I don't know.
* Looking at it...
 * If there was some in there, it was either in the intial stage or had already been filtered.
* Would you find potassium chlorate in the solution?
 * Yes. There would be some residual.
* ...
* I have seen no evidence of what that liquid in the elctrochemical cell is.
* There was water tested, referring to ex57, being exhibit 57, and they found potassium chloride and potassium chlorate.
 * That would suggest it was done or just starting a new round.
* The container beside it... Looking at exhibit 58.
 * The white powder in dish tested for potassium chlorate.
 * Solid to extract water.
 * The two controllers show the temperature and humidity.
 * This is a controlled environment for drying.
* Bottom box...
 * Silica gel.
 * Also drying environment.
 * Same gauges.
 * I don't know what that device is.
 * (Zoom in)
 * It's a fan to circulate air.
* J: Why would you want to dry the potassium chlorate?
 * Otherwise it is very reactive. 
* (next picture) Window above. Tube going outside.
 * It would generate chlorine gas, which you'd want to vent.
* Also item number 60. It was identified as ..., the same drying agent. Can you say anything about that?
 * Excess material?
* (next picture) Pail lid... 
 * Graphite rod?
 * Chlorine vent.
 * Bolts.
 * It sure looks like an electrochemical cell.
* J: What is the importance of a graphite rod?
 * Graphite rod is recommended as the anode for producing chlorates.

(Lunch)

* The agreed statement of fact is already in evidence.
* See pages 6 and 7. There was a purchase made of granular chlorine shock.
 * The pool shock, I haven't seen the bottle, but it is typically a hypochlorite...
* Did you see it amongst the evidence?
 * No, but I haven't seen all the containers. There are some behind the others that one can't see.
* What is the use?
 * To keep a pool clean.
* You were aware of torrents associated with Mr. Sonne's computer.
* You read it. Was there anything in there relating to ...
 * It discusses how to start fire, commit arson. Both electrical and mechanical. It would ignite some sort of accelerant, like a bucket of gasoline. 
 * It could be transferred to making a detonator.
* Were any of the things discussed in the article found in the home?
 * Yes, light bulbs to set things off.
 * LEDs to test the circuits.
 * A soldering iron to make the circuits.
* D: We don't know that it was the same article.
* C: We didn't get it from Mr. Sonne, but the document has the same name.
* J: There will be authenticity questions...
* We will have evidence that not only was it an upload, but there was a book he bought from Amazon.
* The second thing you were asked to look up was a book, Home and Recreational Use of ... Explosives...
 * The author has had fun playing around with explosives in his back yard.
 * They can do that in their back yard in America.
 * A lot of it is black powder like devices.
 * He talks about detonators, and mentions nichrom wires.
 * He also talks about making the explosive RDX.
 * What I found very interesting is that he mentions how to make nitric acid.
* Are the things that would be needed to make the nitric acid present at Mr. Sonne's home?
 * No. A distilling apparatus would be needed.
* Is there anything else that you feel the need to tell the court?
 * There are substantial parallels between what is mentioned in the book and...
* You mentioned earlier that chlorate could be used in a rocket engine?
 * It could be, yes.
* Are you familiar with rocketry?
 * Not really. I've never made them.
 * A propellant burns at a higher rate, but doesn't burn supersonically so it doesn't detonate.
* Could a propellant be used in a detonator?
 * It would burn, a temeparture sensitive explosive could be set off.
 * I don't think a rocket engine could be a detonator.
* If you wanted to make a rocket motor based on things found in Mr. Sonne's house?
 * In the US, you could make chlorates... Add some charcoal, sugar, compress it, seal it with wax. 
 * In Canada, you're not supposed to use chlorates for safety reasons, I think.
 * If you were ingenious enough, you could use a jack.
* Would you use TATP, HTMD...
 * No.
* HDM?
 * I don't know.
* ANFO?
 * No. It doesn't burn fast enough.
* There were several things that could easily be turned into explosives?
 * Yes.
* ...
 * Everything would be classified as precursors. Nothing was an explosive.
* How long would it take to assemble explosive?
 * It depends on what you were making, a couple of hours to a couple of days.
* How difficult would it be to acquire missing ingredients?
 * metal tube could be bought at home depot.
 * citric acid is readily available.
* How many bombs could be manufactured.
 * You could make a minimum of five explosives.
 * If you added them up, you could make 8 to 10 kilos.
 * Most would be the amounium and aluminum powder.
* What size of blast would that be?
* D: I don't think one could turn it into a single explosive.
* J: Yes, I was thinking of asking about that.
 * No, it wouldn't be a good idea.
 * Amonium nitrate and aluminum powder could produce 3kg. 
* J: What explosive was that?
* C: What yield of TATP could be produced?
 * At least a kilogram, from my experience, no wait, 2.9 to 3.4 kilograms assuming 50% yield. The highest yield I've ever seen is 65%. That is a lot of TATP.
 * TATP has been used in person-borne TATP... suicide bombers
 * 3.4 kilograms is about 2 kilograms of TNT. If you add aluminum that increases, I'm not prepared to say how much.
 * Historically, one refers to TNT equivalence.
 * I could take a part the back of the bus with 1 kilo of TNT.
 * The subway attacks were 2 to 3 kilos of something roughly equivalent to...
 * 1 kilogram of HTMD could be produced. If detonated in the back of a bus, it would blow apart the back of a bus.
 * I didn't calculate how much HDM... I didn't try to calculate it.
* What about the ANFO?
 * 2.5kg of amonium nitrate and half a kg of aluminum powder is what we would call an enhanced blast...
* If one was making rocket fuel, would this be a lot or a little?
 * I don't know much about rockets.
 * You wouldn't need much. Hobby rockets are small.
* Given your expertise, did you reach any conclusion as to whether the items in Mr. Sonne's residence were for a specific purpose?
 * It is my opinion that I can think of no other reason, other than, to at some point, make some sort of improvised explosive.

* (Report entered as a exhibit to assist the court...)

Defense Crosses
---------------

* Some questions about your experience with amateur rocketry?
 * Sure.
* You've never done it yourself?
 * No.
* You can't answer the largest size of rocket one might use?
 * No.
* Tne thousand feet?
 * A large one, maybe.
* In terms amount of the energy, you'd need a lot of material.
 * I don't think so.
* I'd like to ask you a few uses of things...
* In particular, your use of the words explosives, propellants, and incendiary devices.
* Would you agree with me that an explosion is a violent and extremely rapid...
 * Yes. I'd note that an explosion is different from detonation. It a deflaration.
 * With explosives, you have a detonation.
 * Classic pipe bomb with black powder. It burns at less than supersonic speeds, but it still explodes.
* Faster than teh speeds of sound?
 * In that material.
* There's a shock wave because it goes across the substance faster...
 * Yes.
* Much faster than a propellant or incendiary....
 * Faster. Six orders of magnitude.
* Can I ask you about propellants.
 * Yes. I may have to say I don't know.
* A propellant releases energy and releases gas?
* Releases an pressurized gas in one direction, and then conservation of momentum requires the object go in the opposite direction. That's the thrust.
 * Yes.
* And there is some cross over between the types of chemicals  one needs ...
 * Some, yes.
* When  one makes a propellant, one wants to make it burn slowly so it doesn't detonate...
 * Yes.
* Add different things to it. Add a binding ...
 * Yes.
* You would be interested in making sure it burns efficiently?
 * Yes. You've done your homework. You'd shape the interior of the engine.
* You've spoken about efficiencies of chemical reaction, there's also an efficiency when you burn something. You want to make sure that there isn't a lot of dead weight.
 * Yes. It's all a question of optimizing. I would think that would require testing.
* Would you agree that one way would be to see how much was left as a residue after you burnt it...
* Touching on that, are you aware of wanting to produce certain types of smoke?
 * You don't want to. In military uses...
* But if one wasn't used in military uses. You might want to have a smoke trail, or colored smoke.
 * I can see why someone might want to do that.
* And it would be possible to add certain chemicals...
 * Yes.
* For example, zinc oxide produces smoke...
 * Yes. And the hexachloro ethane. 
* There was a brilliant crimson die...
 * Yes, it's a standard red die.
* If one was to add that to a smoke creating substance to add color?
 * I don't know if it would. It's organic, it might burn.
* But some chemicals could...
 * Yes.
* You mentioned thermite.
 * There are ingredients for it.
* And that's incendiary...
 * Yes.
* Not a propellant or an explosive.
 * Yes.
* Are there similarities between the types of ingredients between the types of ingredients one uses...
* Some of the chemicals are fuel oxidizer reactions...
 * Yes, but that doesn't mean that 
* Can you describe what you mean by an oxidizer?
 * There is oxygen in the compound, and it reacts...
* Does an oxidizer have to contain oxygen?
 * No.
* Oxygen may be an example of an oxidizer, but there are others. An oxidizer takes electrons from another substance.
 * Yes. Oxidizer reduction reactions.
 * For example, when TNT detonates, the oxidizer is in the same molecule, it just rearranges within the molecule. In others, it is a binary composition.
* At least some of the things you found were fuel oxidizers?
 * Amonium nitrate.
 * HDM.
 * Potassium chlorate.
 * If you turned urea into urea nitrate, that's an oxidizer within the molecule.
* HTMD and TATP are different?
 * That's a controversy. 
 * TATP behaves strangely when the shock wave goes through.
 * I don't know about HTMD.
* In the preliminary inquiry I asked you about the time it takes to make these explosives...
* Approximately 3 kg of TATP could have been produced?
 * Yes.
* One would combine acetone and hydrogen peroxide.
 * Yes.
* Are they combined in certain ratios?
 * We'd have to get into moles.
 * (Explains basic stoichiometry)
* One way to measure a substance is to measure its weight?
 * Yes.
* But if you have a kg of acetone and a kg of the hydrogen peroxide you might have different numbers of molecules...
 * You'd have different weights, you'd have the same number of molecules.
* My question was premised on them being the same weight.
 * (agrees now)
* And a mole is a certain number of molecules, Avogadro's Number
* Reporter: How do spell that?
 * (Spells Avogadro with a y)
* And you would add up the atomic mass...
 * ...
* In making TATP, you used the same amount of moles of each reactant.
 * Yes.
* How much acetone did you use?
 * 2 liters.
* And where did you get that number?
 * From the containers. They looked like one liter each.
* You didn't get it from the center of forensic...
 * Let me check... No I didn't.
* So if you assume  that both the container of acetone and used acetone are full and pure...
 * Yes.
* And if the used acetone had been used that might present problems, depending on what it was used with?
 * yes.
* If it was combined with some other kind of solvent...
 * Finger nail polish works, but it is adulterated.
* To what extent is it adulterated?
 * Maybe it is ninety percent acetone.
* You're just guessing?
 * It's somewhere in that range.

(Break)

* We were discussing TATP, was it the acetone or the hydrogen peroxide that was the limiting factor?
 * Can I check.... It was the acetone.
* So you wouldn't be able to use as much hydrogen peroxide...
* It's not a simple process to make these.
* One has to be careful controlling this chemical reaction... The first step would be mix the acetone and hydrogen peroxide together
 * in a glass beaker in an ice bath.
* Is there a reason to not use plastic?
 * The heat transfer isn't as good.
* In terms of the lab equipment, were there any containers suitable to make two liters of acetone and the hydrogen peroxide...
 * You wouldn't want to do it at once, anyways.
* How many batches would one have to do, given that lab equipment.
 * Quite a few... Could we got back to the pictures?
 * We have one liter beakers it seems on the left side. 
 * If you were courageous enough to make 200 grams at a time, that would be fifteen batches... A small batch would be fine grams.
* 200 grams is getting to a level that would be dangerous, for making it by hand... Where does it become more dangerous?
 * It depends on your experience, and your comfort.
* What about you.
 * The most I've done is 200 grams.
* With equipment like that?
 * Except for how I added acid.
* If we were instead of making 3 kg, we were making 200 grams, that's about one fifteenth. That's about 133 milileters of acetone.
* What is the volume of hydrogen peroxide? 
 * (discussion...)
* 219 mililiters per batch. 
* And they need to be cool. Can you expand?
 * I keep them in the ice pack.
* Then you add the acid. Can you use citric acid here?
 * No, I don't think so.
* You add a very small quantity of acid at a time?
 * Yes.
* Because a chemical reaction occurs and produces heat. You want that to dissipate the heat...
* How long does it take to drope all the drips of acid?
 * It takes several hours. May I explain why?
* Go on.
 * After the first few drops, the temperature jump becomes less severe and you can go a bit faster...
* What is the quantity of acid that is needed?
 * 50 to a hundered milileters for about 200 grams...
* So for all 15 batches, you need ... to 1.5 liters.
  * Because we're using the half concentration acid... That's easier to work with, but you could use the full concentration which requires less...
* What have you got at the end of these few hours?
  * You have a crude TATP product.
* It's a solid, a crystal?
  * Yes.
* And there's a very acidic liquid around it.
 * Yes.

We'll adjourn
