Byron Sonne's Trial, Day 13 (Week 3)
====================================

[Notes taken by Alex]

Crown: 3am written subnmissions done, emailed written copies to Copeland and Judge

J: This morning submissions on severability, and issues arising from ruling on search warrant. 1hr 15min each.

Defense:

Propose to address issues on the search of the computers and explosives.

The doctrine on severability is interesting…

J: The other point, I don't know… Spoken to colleagues, I'm still troubled by the position that you've taken… let's say I accept your proposition that the bad parts can be severed out, does that mean that the good parts evaporate? Having found that the warrant was sufficient in at least one of the main charges, does it follow that the rest should be quashed?

D: This case has many issues with regards to search warrants… we're trying our best.

J: I understand if it's a facial validity and it affects the underpinning.  But if it is completely sufficient with respect to one charge…

D: I'm struggling

J: In terms of severalbility, scientology, follow Johnson

D: Looking at it, what I understand in terms of first principals… Warrant is a completed judiciary order. As I understand, only lawyers could attach so much meaning to the difference between 'a' and 'the'. The test in garafoli is whether 'the' warrant could have issue, not whether 'a' warrant could have issues.

I submit that that is what the ITO submits that 'the' warrant as issued, otherwise you are amending the document.

J: Or are you… automatically into charter remedy for the parts that are bad.  The reality is there was some basis to support this warrant. Based on my findings… conspiracy charge..would have come up during computer search.  I hear what you're saying, but you're not aware of any cases that expressely deal with this?  Hung up on remedies…

D: As I understand it, the warrant is not subject to applications or changes, it falls on the four corners of the ITO.  My read of garifoli is geared towards whether that warrant is issued, could have issued…

J: The reality is the severability…

D: It is and it isn't… the crown was looking for amendment as opposed to severability.  I agree severability is taking a black marker through the warrant… in part, it would strike me that the issue of severability, is perhaps best in this era considered as a factor under 24(2) analysis

J: I do accept htat it would make sense. (this is not part of any ruling), it would make sense if there were some limits.  If you had a situation, if the officer had made it overly broad deliberately, then it might be that there was some basis to quash the whole thing,… but it would be an important factor in a 24(2) analsys.  There is a real question in post-charter.  I'm troubled by the prospect that an otherwise partially valid warrant, issued by a justice, could essentially evaporate, and all of the evidence excluded.  If the warrant's quashed, we're still in 24(2). 

D: If the warrant's quashed, it may not be the worst… there's still the 24(2)… Stepping back for a minute, part of the reason for the judicial order, is to ensure the police are going in in a manner respecting the privacy, that has clarity… if severance becomes the rule, as long as there's something good we can carve out the bad… The incentive is to put everything in and hope for the best.

J: I would imagine most warrants have more htan one offense. I'm just wondering what's happening in the real world.

D: I tried to provide as many cases as possible without inundating you

J: On other garafoly, is it just assumed that there's a severance?  Can you enlighten me on what's happening out there?

D: There's only room for counsel to find an argument that hasn't happened recently… there's case law that supports the doctrine… if you agree that it's a completed judicial order, I couldn't find any case where 'the' meant 'an order' in garafoli.  You are reviewing THE order that is before the court and not just any order… an order could have issued under the following terms, and what the search would have looked like.

J: I think one of the cases looks at what would have obtained.

D: Grabowksi and Patterson were wiretap cases, and prior to 1993 there was an automatic exclusion, that the minute the authorization on a wiretap fell, they were inadmissible.  That is a subject that lends itself that having found an error… there would be automatic exclusion if you find the warrant is faulty…

Patterson… a wide basket clause, no evidence seized in relation to it, the court said the clause sits as a distinct authorization within the larger auth, it's safe just to sever it off.  Where it gets dicey is in a search warrant case… in wiretap, you're searching for one item…. in a search warrant, the offenses need some correlation with the items listed, that adds complications.

Justice fergusons's decision in Lee(?)… And see Jacobson as well.  What is interesting is… these two decisions…both show a different view on the issue of severance.  In lee, there's a warrant that lists one offense which can be committed in two different ways. It's clear that the items that are being sought are being sought cumulatively for that one offense.  Ferguson finds that there were insufficient gronds for supporting both. There may have been sufficient grounds to one means of committing that offense.  In paragraph 57, she notes that… “the applicants concede that if there were no reasonable grounds that the applications intentionally misreported that the former could be severed from the latter”. Ferguson refuses to apply the severability doctrine… in the ITO… offenses combined…

D: The test that is noted in para 36 from jolton and franklin remains unchanged, although there's been some concepts added… “severance will be appropriate when there is a clear line between the good and the bad parts”.  Analysis of a search warrant within a search warrant. Labeled on top of each other… how does the court on review tease out the good from the bad.  And certain issues, justice ferguson, wasn't prepared to do that… it's clear she wouldn't have decided it in that way.  There's an analogy… on the Jacobson decision, the other Ferguson, looking at the branton error, which exists on the face of the warrant in this case, it may be that the branton is answerable in this case. Justice ferguson and Jacobson dmississes the quashing, and notes Jacobson and other wiretap cases.

J: You haven't referred to the branton error… are you referring to that?

D: Let me deal with the branton error…

I accept on the basis of the direction, you don't just look at the first page of the warrant, but rather you read it as a whole.  So you read page one, appendix A and B.  So looking at the first page in this case, it's clear that the officer used a form that is 10 years out of date.  That on it's face may well be the branton error… but to answer that, if you look at the offenses listed, they are listed as completed offenses…

J: I remember you pointing that out…

D: it'd be hard to backtrack on that now

J: It's interesting, I wasn't even aware of the branton error…

D: Constable warrick, and the other warrant, actually uses the new form.

J: They were trying to save paper… (laighter)

D: The new form is in use in other warrants.

J: You're not serious pressing the branton error.

D: no.  The only issue is if the count 4 was not tied to a prior time frame as the other 3 counts are.  That might make the branton error apply to that.  A conspiracy to commit the completed offienses 1 2 3, but if it is not time limited, all of that ultimately is moot.  To an extent the branton error is there minimaly.  But branton is an interesting case … court of appeal doesn't talk about severance, it's a straight quash of the warrant.

So I would clal it a formidable application of it. So Ferguson in Jacobson, says that branton is wrongly decided or applied in Grabowsky, I'm not sure… we can say it's wrongly decided, I don't think it's inconsistent with Grabowsky.  I think Branton can be answered but I don't think it's inconsistent with grabbowsky.

At the ned of the day, police officers are given direction to look for evidence of a future offence, that odes not fall in section (X) of the criminal code, that's pretty substantial.

Ineffactually, branton may be alive and well… The ITO in large measure is for future offenses, I'm not sure if that gets us anywhere in terms of branton. 

It's clear that Jacobson is an example of branton error standing on it's face in that the wrong box was checked on a form and the form was out of date, and there was no risk that officers were going in searching and seizing in relation to future offenses.  It was a completed offense. They were only looking for phone records. So the risk of misguiding the search was nonexistent.  It's distinguishable on the facts…

You may well find that it's distinctual… In terms of the sevferability or the application of, on our warrant, you have found that there's no evidence of conspiracy. My friend conceded that the offense of mischief is a completed offense, and is unsupported in the ITO. You found that there is evidence of count 1 in relation to count 2… it's an odd count, even if there is sufficient grounds to support the commission of that offense, none of the items being sought provide evidence of the commission of that offense.  So in effect that offense may not factor in.  The issue as I see it is if we need to consider, severance… in Appendix A, list of items to be searched for: Items relating to coconspiraters, relates to the fourth count, conspiracy to commit… might relate to the other counts? Not likely… considering that it's a conspiracy to commit, some might argue that if you found… that evidence would also be evidence of those offenses, not necessarily…

J: But then you'd have been into… it's headed “items relating to co-conspiraters”. 

D: This is where the severance doctrine is interesting.  If you're going to sever out several items, how would this search havehappened under a warrant that was properly issued, would they have bene looking at certain things:

J: I understand your point.  If that .. hadn't been there… looking for records relating to any of the offenses… if we're relating to severability… ie, one offense is good, one is bad, the second count is a bit odd, it doesn't say go look for the flickr pictures, (D: they have them!)… we're always going to be ain a situation where were' talking about evidence being seized in severability… if that circumstance had happened.  Here it strikes me that the items related to cocoonspires relates to the count I found to be bad… we're talking about physical things like weapons and bolts and records… the rest I found relates to the first charge, and it's pretty easy to sever. In a 24(2) analysis should the crown be able to rely…

D: The courts seem to be reluctant to get into the reconstruction of what the search would have looked like.

J: There was one case..evidence seized good part bad part.

D: In this case it is clear… “items to be used for the destruction of public property”… is listed as

J: I found could be used as count 1…  using bolts in the future…

D: It also relates to an offense that has gone bad…

J: Mischief… if it's a completed offense… had there been evidence of prior use of the bolts to scale the fence.

D: Maybe the last one is a clearer example..items related to the interruption of communications. That is clearly a mischief count.

J: I found that that was part of count 1…

D: But if … found that it was part of both… the word of the mischief count… the structure of the ITO struck me that that evidence was primarily towards the mischief count.  Evidence counts towards both a good and bad count. Severability ought not to apply… can't neatly divide it out..

J: if you can't figure out the good and the bad, if it's both good and bad, surely the good overrules the bad… In terms of the ultimate problem… if they were able to take the wave guide under count 1, does it matter that they could have also taken it under mischief?

D: I submit that that's a factor htat is against applying severance but may be a factor under 24(2). Case law… clear line between good and bad, then you can sever.  The warrant is a warrant inside a warrant… overlapping…

The goal is to give clear direction to the officers, they're misled…

J: they're not misled, they're looking for two counts… everything that's left relating to count 1.  If you couldn't…I  guess it comes back to what do they mean by clear line of demarcation.

D: Constable French breaks down hwo the items link to various items of interest.  Under 'destruction' he talks about the disabling of cameras but doesn't mention the wave guide.  Under 'communications' he specifically mentions the wave guide. In this officers mind, he may have been linking the wave guide not to the initial offense but to mischief.

J: I'd have to look at the ITO… he definitely Talks about the wave guide that could interfere with video cameras. Anyway, I understand your point.

D: If the items to be searched for are overlapping, they are not clearly severable. And if they are, certain items need to ome out on the standards analysis , items related to conspirators,

J: I can understand the argument the items related to conspirators was taken to be related ot the other counts, but if we treat it thway its stated there… that's that count I found was unsupported

D: The wave guide… your honor has made a finding… the count relates to a threat to destroy property, under appendix A, the officers notes 'wave guide, used for disruption used for disrupting communication', not as something to be used for destroying property.  In the previous paragraph, for destruction, he mentions items to be used under items to be used to destroy.

J: I understand… given the ITO… given my findings… the gwave guide… If its covered twice, once general once specific…

D: The warrant should given direction to cops, to know what they are searching for … how are htye to assess that any item can be used to destruct cameras and make the connection between that and the wave guide, which is otherwise set out in a separate thing…

J: You mean if the wave guide hadn't been mentioned specifically… that it could be used to damage…

D: Anytime an officer adds 'that can be correlated' it's just to search a particular area… The fact that the wave guide is dealt with separately suggests that in this officers mind he did not contemplate the wave guide being used to destroy property. In the ITO a para suggests that a HERF could be used…

J: If that's true..what would have happened in terms of severability…. If the wave guide could have been seized as an item for destruction.  If that's the case, is it not still severable? In terms of cops going in and seizing things and having to figure out

D: It may not be a strong issue on 24(2), they would have found that item… keeping in mind that inaddition… it's a conspiracy to commit the four offenses that are listed… on some level that does, in terms of… it adds to a confusion emanating on the face of the warrant. Necessitating exclusion per say, on the 24(2) analysis… 24(2) isn't undertaken piecemeal… knock-on effect, going back to Grant… 1993… there the perimeter search was found to be unlawful but the… supreme court found that the warrant was fine, it couldn't sever out the conduct… and the process was tainted... a few weeks ago, back to Grant… a series of charter violations can be important factor for exclusion.

I would ask the court to consider a clear and deliberate violation of Sonne's rights… flawed search warrant in relation to the cottages… there's a lot more than would fall on this simple error… there's more animated discussion at that point. Grant 1993, it remains a reliable analysis …

J: I need to… talk about it at some point… if this were the onmly issue, hyou wouldn't be advancing much of an argument of 24(2) quashing vs. severing.

D: There's a computer search…

J: You're asking me to reserve… if I were to accept your submissions you don't want me otimmediately  go to a 24(2)…

D: If your honor finds that the same search would have been conducted under the warrant that ought to have been issued… that that standing alone would give me an uphill battle on any 24/(2) analysis.  Where it gets dicier though is that even with severance, in this case, we still then get into a computer issue, co-conspirators… fall out of the warrant, and there would still may or may not be.

J: Is there am idle position where I can find that it can't be severed but I can tease out the items that might be severed… 24(2) analysis.   You said… if the same search had been conducted… at this point it means the items co-conspirators…

D: That would end the search of computers… arguably, it would appear to me that the computer seized under 2nd warrant.

J: Crown says it wasn't seized under either warrant… this ruling would be released…

D: Nature of the discussion… applying the severance…

J: Whether it's severable or not… it seems to me that it's simple enough to say… what was seized pursuant to co-conspirators… and what was seized relating to the first count… clearly the search… warrant that ought to have been, the search would have been the same. Severable or not… that's the difference here.  If the whole warrant is quashed we're into  a 24(2) for everything. If not, only for co-conspirantors.  I'm talking jus about this warrant. 

Bottom line is, apart from other violations, will it really matter?

D: The prior authorization needs to have some meaning… it is a method of control… prior control over intrusions and to treat it lightly on some level seems to go behind… if your honor finds…

J: I'm not suggesting that I would be treating it lightly. Nature of the error… issusing justice… none of the excisions based on the conspiracy charge… … … haven't found bad faith on the part of French… does the system get faulted when the justice made an error?

D: That ought to be recognized… as a section 8 violation… it's important enough… the officers are supposed to be given guidance… look for conspiracy.. .can also be physical items…

J: Your argument leads that anytime a warrant is overly broad… it would have to be quashed.  Shouldn't be able to sever it out if there was evidence seized under a bad offense.

D: It does lead to that.  It seems to be an animated feature… it would probably come up with a hypothetical… tease out the good from the bad… on this one, it's all overlapping on some level, it might not be a palatable outcome… quashing the warrant… Severance was born of an era trying to avoid the harsh impact of finding a quashing.  Now it is an issue that can be dealt with under (24)2

If I can just briefly address the second warrant: As an example, the explosives offenses are added, no suggestion that they relate to the other charges, 2nd warrant different conditions might apply… distinct charges… context is different. 

On the issue of the computer search on 2nd warrant, only mention that computer may contain evidence in relation to explosives is in the ITO page 5, under 'grounds to believe that the items seized will afford evidence of the offenses', and in para 4, there is the notation 'the chemical books, computers, passes, and wave gun, are items that have been used in sonne's operation of making chemicals'.  That's the only reference… under subheading a, under items relating to explosive substances, it lists “computers”.

All you have is a statement that the copmuters have been used by Sonne to make chemicals. You can't even tell if the computers have been used to make chemicals or if they've been used to post pictures.  Clearly the passes or wave gun didn't get used to make chemicals…

J: There was some evidence of the computer being used to forge passes… because of the tweet… but there's nothing in the ITO that suggests how the computers would have been used for chemicals.  The officers had to have some evidence that the computers had been used… it wasn't an attempt to seize them, but an effort to look for records related…

D: they don't need to know, they just have to have grounds… this officer has no basis… he may have articulated some theoretical basis… we know from Morelli how computer is an inherentely protected place..just to get into the computers… the mere assertion… it seems too far removed.. If this officer had opined that speaking with bomb squad… some suggestion that there's a computer used… at least something…

J: Is it your position that computers can be severed out?

D: Yes, the warrant should fall, but should this more readily get the severance? Maybe… I'm happier to have the warrant fall… I don't see the search being justified on what's left inthat 2nd warrant.

J: Crown, you want to start now?

C: on severability issue, obviously my friend… crown's position is clear… di luca's position has a thread of logic through it… more compelling argument in pre-charter days when it was all or nothing… the law could well have gone that way.  The reality is the law did not go that way.  Charter with us for 30 years now.Severability is alive and well… as a means of saving a warrant from a breach. Severability is not acticated at the remedy stage… that is the law.

J: What do you say about the concern I raised about the warrant couldn't be severed… there's still a good part… there isn't a decision that counsel provided… talks about any basis that the warrant… the fact that there is a good part… can't be severed… maybe that is how severability has been developed.  Is it automatic that it's severable or not?

C: my response is that it all turns out what you mean by … in a sutation where … what we're talking about in warrant each term in one document is an authorization to do something. That's the key assumption. You run into a situation where two terms are so intertwined that you can't remove one and leave the other.  You'd have an order that made no sense or one that authorized something thwas wrong.

J: look at the face of the warrant and see that it still works.

C: If some is still good and the good can stand on its own, then you don't have the link problem… it is a problem of what are two separate terms…

J: In a situation where evidence is seized in a good part and bad part.

C: Lets talk about what the warrant authorizes you to do… in this case, my friend has argued in terms of items that can't be removed from the warrant becuasei t's linked… I submit that because of the appendix… removing from the document not having any effect… What happens when you have separate terms that seem to authorize the seizure of the same item, and you say this offense is no good, so you can't take that cup, but you do authorize it…

J: the wave guide… di luca's argument saying it doesn't apply…

C: what you have are two terms that authorize the seizure of the wave guide. Swince you have a redundancy, you can't consider that a problem… here's the example… a house that has two power sources, one is normal power, and the other is a generator… you've got two things that do the same thing, light your house, but would anyone say because you've got those two doing the same, that they are so linked you couldn't separate them? You can detach hydro and go on the generator… or I can remove the generator.

Same issue here.  If you have two seizure terms, one is which related… there is no problem. If cops gointoaa house thinking they have authority on two and later find they had only one, what difference does it make. It's a redundancy.

J: Going to have to read the Ferguson decision…

C: This took six hours of my time…

J: Ferguson goes on… concession that one of the modes … good modes or bad modes…

C: (arguing about Ferguson, knocks out the offense, blah blah blah)

C: To the extend that you have  redundancy y ou have no problem… cops going into a home thinking he's got two basis, in fact he only has one, doesn't matter.

I submit that the whole effect of garafoly… the whole effect… to reviewing the search warrant… the point is that garafoli is about a rejection of formalism… making a warrant that has 10 good terms and 1 bad term fall for that reason alone… would be to embrace formalism… there's nothing improper with removing terms, it's the same warrant…

J: well, if the search is much broader than it would have nbeen or or ought to have been… a search for records would be quite invasive in a case like this…

C: but that's a manner of search issue, not a facial validity issue. I'm not saying that severance cures all problems… there may be problems… but that's not an issue of severance.

J: If I were to reach the conclusion that I couldn't sever… and the warrant falls… what would happen? I guess that's ….

C: if court were to come… I think the only way the entire would fall… you would have to find that the conspiracy is so linked to every other term that it has to fall. If the conspiracy is not intertwined that it can't be undone, to drop the entire warrant could only be done if the court chose to ignore severability.

J: My understanding under garafoli, one offense was supported… couldn't sever… whole warrant fails… 'the' vs 'a' warrant… if that were the case, I wonder why this wouldn't come up a lot more.

C: exactly, we don't see this every day …

J: maybe everyone is severing…

C: I don't do it… you've got a presumed valid order… 10 of these terms are fine, but term number 11 is a problem… intuitively, the fact that the 11th term brighs down the entire warrant, it doesn't make sense

J: Computers…

C: There's no discretion not to apply severance.

J: I'm going to look at the question of severance… Im troubled that if there's no severance, what would happen if… does mean… there was no section 8 violation… unless the whole warrant is bad.

C: In order for… intertwined with every other term…

J: In that case I couldn't sever.

C: you'd have a one-term warrant… breaks it up on paper… remove one component, nothing remains… but that's not what we're dealing with.

J: No, but that's a different view of severability…

(morning recess).

J: What would work out best… restart this when I come back from my trip… Tuesday after Family Day, we're not going to get it In before I go…  (21st or something of February)… going to Antarctica…

C: I'm going on a ski vacation March 15th…

C: Brenton error thing… reluctant to address it… there are only two cases which address it… I don't think I need to worry too much… Brantoncan not be right on this issue… my point is… Branton doesn't apply to every warrant… We don't need to worry… In this case, we look at the entire warrant, the problem does not exist.  The clarity of which the offenses are… Overbreadth of potential search… concern about perverse incentives..the reality is when you look at the facts on the ground, this issue almost never comes up… I've had this issue mentioned once before… this is not…

J: Where are all the other cases like this one where there's a garagoly search warrant… That doesn't arise?

C: That doesn't come up. The offenses are unique and new.  It's not something easy, like murder of assault or robbery.

J: Mischief…

C: Let me amend… Some of the offenses… intimidation… this is largely a function of unusual circumstances… the facts weren't as cut and dry… this required more thought and implications… more room for circumstatincial reasoning…

J: I don't know at what point officers…

C: It's unusual circumstances.. This issue of the actual offenses is not an issue I've ever encountered.

J: You mean where some are good and some are bad.

C: We don't have to worry about an epedimic of overbroad warrants because the police think the crown can rely on severability…  In terms of the argument that my friend made in terms of severability… I don't have any futher submissions.

Two other issues

First one: …

J: … I do recall… timing reasons… something or other… mumble mumble…

C: I guess… it's still valid… the ITO for the first warrant is included in the 2nd warrant.  It's a fair point that in 2nd warrant, whats evidence you're looking for… it's a fair observation that there doesn't appear to be one.

J: Given the decisions, in the ITO, I wasn't too critical of the officer… these pictures were cops in uniforms… on duty… How does that provoke a state of fear from the general public?  There might be an argument by extending that… the general public…  I was able to sort that out on the first count… wasn't so sure on the 2nd… I think she could win an award for longest mumble right now… if I take the view on severability…

C: If you accept mr. di luca's argument… I've agreed that mischief is out, the whole house of cards falls down… there's not a request to deal with evidence that only applies or only applies to that… nothing!

J: it didn't cause any additional…

C: The question becomes… to the extent that the officer was trying to be comprehensive in articulating the offenses… can the count be sustained, and I think the answer is yes.  I would invoke the vary reasonsin in paragraph 148 page 38… it is the same issue.  Your honer says “given the height of the security around the G20, public being threatened by pulling down fences, taking photos of cops with caption “bacon at work” and “bacon on wheels”, this could be intended to provoke a state of fear”…

In the same way that suggesting to the world that you're willing or able to dismantle the key security apparatus( the fence), making the statement that I have people keeping you safe (cops) will have the same effect… threshold of fear. .. a state of fear of some degree. It applies if you have the people that keep everyone safe under surveillance.  You're targeting them. If you disagree with that, we cut it out, and the rest of it stands(?)

There can be no link…

The computer thing, in relation to the june 23rd ITO.  We're talking about records on the computer… that in fact is what he in appendix A is what he wants to search for, items related to the production of explosive substances.  Records relating to the production of explosives. Contained through files, books, reports, notes, applications, etc… . .. .. which can be stored electronically or on paper.

What you have there are types of documents and two potential modes of storage.

The question you put ot my friend is “is it not the case that the only reference in the ITO is found on page 5, the 'chemical books', isn't there anything else there”.  And I agree there isn't anything directely…

But it goes back to Para 5 page 4, it deals with the HTMD… when you get to the bottom, it talks about “in addition to the items mentioned, it also located lab equipment for making explosives, beakers, containers, pyrite, electrolysis…”

J: They located those things, but I do not confirm they were used to make explosives.

C: We have a guy who has in his home the chemicals to make, he has a laboratory, and he has books/etc.  So we have all of that…

J: What I said about that… related books was related to chemical books, (not explosives)

C: So what you have is the books related to the lab, and the lab is related to the chemsicals.  I submit that once you take that… that there's a reasonable basis to believe that they are connected to these chemicals.  Onceyou accept that and you go back to the june 22 ideal about his extensive use of computers, and that he uses computers to advance whatever plan or agenda he's got… and it appears that through his computer postings, he likes to build and tinker, and likes to chronicle…

J: We have to be careful there… I didn't put everything in under chronicle…

C: But even if you take what you amplified… even things as simple as showing the boards where he blew items through the boards… he's a person who likes to use the computer… he used it to do many things in his life. He's someone who'se savvy with computers..  He's got books that are connected to his lab… and his use of computers in his hobby in taking things apart, it is a reasonable believe that mr.sonne would not turn his back on the internet in pursuing his interests in how you make things and put things together and modify them. 

I think on the basis of the big picture, it would be unreasonable for someone to say there is no basis wouldn't have availaled himself of this treasure trove of information (computer) and would resort only to books and documents.  The reasonable of that belief that he'd have used his computer… to assist him… that is a reasonable belief.  Even through French talks about computers on Page 5, what we're talking about is computer records.  If he uses computers are much as we know he does, and he's got books and documents, which are connected to the lab, we have sufficient basis to search that computer for documentation of any variety… instructional, his thoughts, his emails, you have a reasonable basis to go through that computer.

J: (Something about explosives…)

C: In terms of , is there a problem with the search term? Is it unjustified? No, there isn't. One does have to follow a chain of circumstancial reasoning, but it is a valid chain.  There is a basis to reasonably follow that chain of reason, on the amplified record.  Subject to your questions, we don't have anything more to say. 

D: The chain of reasoning that my friend provided the court… should have been evidence in the ITO… the officer states a conclusion and doesn't connect it.  It needs to be on a good faith baiss… on a mior technical manner… the minute you have… today's day and age, anyone who demonistrates computer savvy and you go on a search warrant does it mean you can go on their computer.s

We know from Mirelli that getting into a computer… searching the records… privacy issues.

J: On one extreme… you couldn't search the computer… they know there are computers… and books related to chemicals…  There's no evidence of actual… use of the computer for the purpose in the ITO.

D: An apart from the assertion there would be evidence.

J: I guess the question is… how far can you draw inference from.

D: French didn't bother to explain his thought process… what we have in the ITO is just a bald assertion on his part.  On the issue of severance… The 2nd count may actually provide a clearer example of a count that can be svered from an ITO.  It falls within the classic grabowski scenario.  You look at it, there's no evidence supporting it.  If it comes out that it can be nearly svered out… it does highlight the difficulty with the other counts that they are all overlapping… add in conspirancy, branton error… justice hill calls it the Branton Error…

He didn't take the view that this is an arcane throwback or that you shouldn't NOT quash a warrant because of the error… he says it's not a case for severability… he doesn't describe why…

J: I'm troubled when a court I'm bound by decides something without referring to it… one would have expected severability to be raised.

D: I don't think Branton stands for the position that every overarching thing kills the warrant…

J: Is there any reason why… Branton should have considered severability? It suggests to me that counsel got the ruling by surprise… or didn't think…

D: I don't know, I don't have… it miht have answered your question… In branton the errors were multiple, there was a huge overseizure… this was back when you could borrow radio signals from the US without subscribing… could the CRTC only require people to subscribe to a Canadian signal… they shut down his business by seizing everything in the business…  was it even an offense… I accept that it may be a bit of a throwaway, but it still stands to reason on the issue of prospective offenses, section 48 you can't get warrants on offenses that aren't offenses… a warrant needs to guide the officers… they're going to have some knowledge of what they are to look for… items related to prospective offensies… they are out side the terms of the warrant.

There is that odd conspiracy count #4 here, is it a completed? You found there was no evidence.  Is it a completed conspiracy to comment the offense, or future offense? We don't know. It's poorly drafted.  That's kind of the thinking around the Branton error. 

Last point… there are six offenses listed on the ITO, nominally 4,… 3 offenses plus 3 to conspiracy to commit… one out of six offenses remains. There are four categories of evidence listed… arguably two remain.  Multipling 1/6 by ½ gives you 1/12, apparently the good in this warrant is about 8.3%.  The bad would be 91.7% give or take.  This shows there's a discretion for an issuing judge… … whether we're severing out so much of the warrant… 8 %? What is left? Are you getting into the issues where the issuing judge's discretion to issue the warrant is engadged? He has the authority to say 'this isn't good enough'

J: I'm not here to do an appeal

D: No no, no judge COULD have… severance HERE is discretionary, they're not obligated to sever… and certainly on some level you're guided… not circumvented… you'e netting out so much through sever that it is a different search… and then discretion should apply.  I submit that the good and bad overlap significantly.

J: The argument that Byrne makes is that there is an overlap… mumble mumble… If you're looking at can you take scissors and cut out portions and cut out portions and still have a good warrant..yes.  In this warrant, can you look at what they got… yes..  That one is a complete overlap… so they could have gotten the wave guide under one or the other… in terms of the policy… we don't want to encourage the police to prepare overly broad warrants… the officer I found had a … mumble mumble… he didn't investigate it properly… the conspiracy count falls not because of… the failure of the officer… I don't have a sense from the evidence overall that it was just thrown in to do a broader search.  You could have said because of the tweets… the idea was to get the computer… it wasn't even… didn't try to get an order to seize the computer.

D: It does start to cross the line… from it wasn't perfect… at a certain point it really starts to circumvent the purpose of authorization… severance doesn't come up that often.

J: except on taking that to the next level… the issuing justice wasn't tricked on giving a warrant on conspiracy… if 'm look at why are we here on that count, the officer didn't address the conspiracy…

D: even on the 24(2) analysis… assume there's no insition… ought not to have issued… that's a serious breach… it may not be the PO's fault… didn't hold the justice's hand… but it's still a failure of the system… justice stands as a check and balance on the police search.

J: I'm not tyring to minimize the issue in terms of overbroad… it is relevant that that isn't what happened here… if the officer had put in a whole bunch of stuff to support… tweets coming back, agreement to pull down the fences, and that was made up, the justice would not be aware of that… from her perspective, that would be a whole other case… it doesn't mean that if there's no bad faith, but the overbroad is issued… the system failed… that means that the end.

D: That discussion is appropriate within 24(2) and severance.

J: As Mr. Byrne ssaidther's post-charter cases… it's an interesting issue…

D: There's not a whole lot of case law… this could be under 24(2)… old-skool but novel once again.

J: It's not the first time I've been told it's an issue… I'm going to reserve this decision… my plans is to have everything done by… judging from… mumble mumble… written decisions done…

D: I will make an overarching submission..knock-on effect: everything should go, and alternative submission for all of the evidence seized, some of the evidence, the computer, the statements…

J: I'll be in a position to give you all the written decisions... when trial resumes… full week, I'll have to work through things enough as I did for the search warrant issue…

C: It's fair to say we won't be starting the trial next week…

J: No matter what I do the trial …

C: Mumble mumble…

J: I would have thought…

C: It's going to make a difference…

J: I appreciate that… if I exclude the explosives…

C: We're going to want that… it would be a short trial…

J: That's one way to get us back on schedule…

C: Mumble… (laughter)

J: Probably set aside four weeks… so there's no issue…

(lunch break)

(Looks like we'll be looking at photo evidence here… an officer is on the witness stand, monitors and projectors are hooked up in the courtroom.  The first photo is one of byron's home office, visibie are a mac laptop, a bunch of wires, an external CD rom drive, a large tube labeled “Extended Range Wifi” (essentially a pringles can-style wifi antenna) a cheap ikea lamp, a second monitor, a map of the world, a bookshelf full of books 

J: The submissions I received from mr. Copeland and mr.byurns going in the court file. Ready to start on computers.

C: We are ready.  Blah blahblah, IT guys on site, we are ready. The first witness will be detective constable Meneticus(?).

(sworn in)

Alvin Maniquis Badge #8307

C: Been with TPS since 2001?

A: Yes

C: With Asian organized crime task force in 2010?

A: Yes

C: Still with?

A: Yes

C: Describe duties

A: Investigator, search warrants, investigative duties…

C: On june 22, 2010… became involved with investigation?

A: Yes

C: How?

A: on that day at 10:45pm I attended 13 div with detective (?) in regards to a G20 arrest. Told it was Sonne, there was an address, search warrant was executed. 

C: Officer in charge?

A: Tam Bui…

C: As “C” manager what was your job

A: To oversee the search team to ensure the items seized.

C: If I was an officer and I found something that might be of interest?

A: Notify me, I make the decision to seize it… step up and see what's necessary

C: Your role is different from the … exhibit officer… he records everything…

A: Yes

C: Prior to arriving did you have futher involving / know more?

A: Before, early morning 23rd I conducted my own open online search for torontogoat/Byron sonne to see what I cound find. I found some g20 things on youtube, twitter, a blog… I made a small report and tried to capture the pictures onto the report… I made a report

C: what did you do with it?

A: I completed it and submitted it to our file managent system MCS(?)

C: At some point a second warrant was obtained, you attended?

A: On the 23rd I attended at 9am… the scene was contained wit hthe G20 mobile support team, officers in uniform, and they had the address secure.  There was a crime scene log Waited to get authorization

C: How long ?

A: A few hours… I spoke with FIS crew along with sergeant in charge, gave a quick breakdown on open source web,

C: why?

A: It's easier if people going in to search have background of what they're going into, so they conduct themselves when inside.  The knowledge from the internet would help then understand what needed to be searched.

C: What other information did you have?

A: I had the appendix… around 1, Chong had the warrant and the appendix, and we all had a briefing… read over the appendix… that's pretty much it.  Shortly after, attended the garage, executed.

C: Number of computers and related wereseixzeD?

A: yes

C: do you know how many?

A: I remember two computers in the office… I can't give an exact number.

C: We have a screen… … (talk about computer screen setup… password screen timed out, have to call in another guy to type his password).

C: We're looking at a photo right now…

A: It's the office area inside the house.

C: Is that taken the day of the search?

A: Ues

C: Next photo… wait, can I daraw your attention to the bulletin board?

A: Yes

C: Is that how it looked?

A: Yes

A: Yes

C(photo of bulletin board) tell us what we're looking at

A: It's the bulletin board

C: What are the two white papers on the bottom left?

A: A picture of the G20 fence line, and cityt streets, etc.

(entered into evidence as 13 A)

C: With respect to the computers there… whos'e decision was it to szei?

A: Mine

C: Why?

A: In relation to the charges, production of explosives, mischief, I felt that the computers were the gateway for all the blogs and social media, digital photography, video on youtube, that had to be uploaded took place on these computers.  I felt that these computers need to be seen so we can extract that

C: What did you know about mr.sonne before you searched his home

A: Extensive background of computers, digital field, blogs, he was highlight regarded on hacker blocks, hackernews, if you were recognixzed on there you're tech savvy… I thought his things that we found came from these computers in sonny's house.

C: did you make efforts to search the computers onsite?:

A: no, once I was aware, we didn't search on-scene, no-one including myself were qualified to do that kind of search on a computer, plus we didn't want to risk losing information by trying to login. In my experience, people put fail safes, password locks, software that can wipe a whole hard drive, if we were trying to enter stuff, or unplugging fomr the wall, so I called detective Papizewski from IT… called our adviser that we did frind some computers, she would send her own guys to seize them.

C: did anyone arrive?

A: They did the following day, we kept the scene until we completed the full rendering of the scene using FIS, and 3D machine, and video and photos before we touched anything, and no one from my search team physically touched anything, didn't want to lose evidence of booby trapped…

C: were they unplugged?

A: No, I didn't touch anything, and I don't think the other officers tampered with it… I gave htem a briefing on booby traps…

C: it was your decision to seize?

A: I just felt that on the appendix it said to seize the computers and storage devices, in relation topexploexis… I felt that computers can have a lot of information… I think it would be very large or cumbersome… internat accessed through computer 

C: Given your knowledge of the search did you come across books about exploisives?

A: There was a book… can't remember… a few books science or physics related, it was on the back shelf, can't remember.

C: No more questions.

Copeland crosses.

D: Can I ask you what materials you have reviewed in relation to this case before coming today?

A: Social media report, my notes, Something… search warrant.

D: You became involved at 9:45pm on june 22nd

A: Yes

D: Initial responsibility?

A: yes

D: Agree with me… number of issues hyou were concerned about? The security of premises?

A: Yes

A: Yes

D: You mentioned a crime scene law of (?)

A: Yes

D: Security matters… agree with me that the integrity is of importance?

A: Yes

A: Yes

D: The evidentiary value of something may depend on where it is?

A: Yes

D: AS crime scene manager, you were the onsite supervisor for 2nd warrant?

A: Yes

D: When warrant was granted on 23rd, it was delivered by Shawn?

A: Yes

D: Personally

A: Yes

D: did you review it?

A: Yes

D: In terms of what you received, there's an order: warrant plus appendix A and B, there's also information to obtain? Did you receive the information to obtain? Or just the order?

A: The order and A and B.

D: (asks for a document from the registrar), volume 1 of application record.

Volume 1, Tab 7A. Take a moment to look at that and ask me what you recognize. First few pages.

A: This is the first warrant dated June 22nd.

D: Lets go to tab B. Same question. Recognize that?

A: First page, yes. Appendix A and B, yes.

D: First 5 pages, yes?

A: Yes.

D: So it's only the first 5 pages that were delivered to you?

J: Referring now to… a page within…

D: We can start at the beginning of Tab B. There's a document titled Warrant to Search, an exhibit something d'andra, you've seen the first page…

A: yes

D: now the second page may be out of order… 'Information to obtain the search warrant'? Did you receive this?

A: No, I received appendix A and B.

D: The third page is appendix A, the list of items to be searched for?

A: Yes

D: The 5th page is the offenses, appendix B, in relation to the search.

A: Correct.

D: In your role as supervisor for the execution, it's an important thing for you to understand the terms of the warrant?

A: yes

D: It's also important to ensure your team understands?

Yes

D: It's fair to say that you reviewed this document carefully?

A: yes, and my whole team read it

D: I want to ask you… a couple questions about your understanding. May not be relevant to section 8, but may be relevant to 24(2).

Starting page 1, search warrant… signed by a judge… justice marshall… starts off with the recitals… (reads from warrant) at 58 elderwood drive… certain things, namely, reference to appdix A… suspected, intended, commission of offence, see list of offences.

You understand that the next part is the actual order?

A: Yes

D: Therefore this is to authorize and require you between 11:15am today and 9pm june 27 to enter into the premisis and to search for and seize the above things, and to bring them before me or some other justice to be dealt with.

A: Yes.

D; That's what you were qauthorized and required to do.  And there is a time limitation on the face, and there is an address that you are authorized to enter into.

A: Right.

D: You can't go in and search at a different time. And you can't search a different place.

A: Right.

D: Turn to Appendix A. Under the heading 'items relating to co-conspirators': There's some language in the first records authorized to be searched for and seized… records of the names and phones numbers of dealers, whether associates or friends, stored on storage records, (lists types of records).

A: Yes 
D: That's one of the items that you reviewed. At the itme you executed the search, what did you understand the term “dealers”

A: Businesses, or… who can supply certain products… anything… anyone can supply what can be made… what we were looking for explosive devices…

D: your understanding of 'dealers' has to do with transaction in commercial context…

A: or personal…

D: So… did you understand that 'dealers' posed a restriction? Couldn't be just any old records…

A: It would be… (?)

D: In your experience… many search warrants?

A: Correct

D: How many?

A: 20 more or less

D: Is it your understanding… is there a relationship between the items to be searched for and the offenses that are in Appendix B?

A: Yes

D: Can't search for any old records… habve to search relating to the offenses.

A: Yes.

D: At least to seize it.

A: yes

D: Now, there's a reference in the first clause to magnetic data storage units, phones, etc… what did you understand this to mean? In terms of your authority to deal with computers, cell phones, etc.

A: When It comes to cmoputers, EM data storage… it's our practice that we seize that and deliver it to our computer guys to examine it and take what is necessary.

D: Maybe a step ahead… let me focus in.  Was it your understanding that it authorized to search for copmuters and to seize computers.

'A: Yes

D: It was your belief that you had authority to seize a computer.

A: Reading the whole thing yes.

D: Would you agree with me that the first word of that clause is… lets first clause… is 'Records of the names and phone numbers'… it seems ot be authorizing a search for records for phne and name of a certain class and person.

A: (mumbles)? Not sure what you are asking

D: The suggestion is that the clause mentions records of names and phone numbers of dealers as the item to be searched for and the thing ot be seized. And then there's a list of different media on which those records might exist. That you could search through. That's my question. Was it your understanding that you could seize the computers under the warrant itself.

A: Not just that clause, the whole clause, the whole appendix, after reading it. I believe I could search for it, seize the computers, the electronic devise.

D: Help me ID the parts of appendix A that said you could seize a computer.

A: The bottom paragraph… “Records that relate to the production of explosives… information which can be stored electronically or on paper.”.

D: You agree with me that that clause begins with the word “Records”… in relation to the production of explosives

A: right.

D: And then there's a description of explosives… that are retained… You didn't understand this to mean that you could search for records, you understood it to mean you could search for computers.

A: To me the computer has the record on it, the best way to extract evidence without losing it is to seize the computer.

D: Without looking at the contents of the computer, how do dyou know it's there?

A: Through my earlier open source researching, social media report, there is over 200 digital photos uploaded to flickr( describes flickr). You can only do this with a computer… knowing that digital aspect of how they showed up, and youtube video was uploaded, to me those devices were the ones used to author those photos..for the whole world to see.

D: Did you have any information whether those blogs/social media had been updated and maintained by a computer within the address of 58 elderwood.

A: No.

D: Would you agree that you really thought was that the records MIGHT be on the computers?

A: possible.

D: Possible. You wanted to be thorough…

A: yes.

D: You didn't want to leave anything behind that might contain?

A: yes

D: You didn't just seize one, you seized a number?

A: Yes

D: Extenral hard drives? Thumb drives?

A : Yes, Yes

D: Electronics, and electromagnetic data storage units.

A: Yes

D: And before you authorized it, you had no idea of the contents.

A: No. No idea.

D: Before moving on from appendix A would you agree there were a number of books. 

A: Yes

D: Books are one thing that are mentioned in the last clause.  But you certainly didn't seize every book. You didn't grab bookshelves and take htem out of the residence and review the contents later?

A: No, during the search I instructed the team to search through the books to see for paper inside, they can be hollowed out, hidden cameras in the books, hard drives, asked them to flip through, and leave the ones unrelated, like philosophy and poems

D: You did seize 'understanding physics'?

A: Yes

D: Chemistry?

A: There were some kind of scientific books.

D: None had the word 'explosives?”?

A: Can't recall

D: Something to do with science, and that's why they were of interest?

A: yes

D: Might have contained information relevant to explosives?

A: Some devices I saw on the blogs... you't get how they wor k through some kind of science book.

D: Were the books… seized because they might explain how devices worked, like the wave guide?

A: To me the information might have been used to construct.

D: Those books… did the seizing have anything to do with this clause relating to records of explosives.

A: yes.

D: You mentioned the crime scene log… do you have copy?

A: No

D: I'm going to show you a document… 'major crime scene log', yourecognize this?

A: yes

D: (confirms location and date, start time, Bui's name, does he recognize it?)

A: (flips through document)

D: Start time is in the evening on june 22?

A: yes

D: There are columns at the top… (talk about the document some more) reason for the entries… First 8 entires are for the CBRN team? No times recorded?

A: No

D: Did you have a hand?

A: No, I attended 23rd at 9am.

D: Had time to review?

A: Yes

D: Find the earliest time recorded on this log.

A: June 22nd…

D: may be some things that are back-filled.

A: 10/06/22-23, 22:00 hours.

D: Someone goes in, PC mailer, badge number, the reason nfor entry is intel?

A: yes

D: Time in is 10pm?

A: Yes

D: Time out is 00:53?

A: Yes

D: First entry with time recorded?

A: Yes

D: No times recorded for other team?

A: No.

D: Next time is sergeant meamey?

A: Yes

D: Look at bottom of page 2, a backfilled entry.

A: Yes

D: There are two FIS officers, a late entry… and you wanted to record that information…

A: It wasn't ME recording it.

D: but it's consistent with practice that you include times prior to the start of the log?

A: On my scenes I keep the person with the log in once place.  We made one point of entry for the house which was the garage.

D: The earliest time of entry is 7:25PM on June 22nd.

A: Entry meaning the scene not the house.

D: you understood that some had entered in the first search warrant? None of that is reported in your log?

A: I don't ..

D: You don't know the times they went in?

A: I can't answer that

D: AS you're arriving june 22nd, there's potential the scene had been disturbed?

A: I arrived on 23rd at 9am, I had no reason to believe - the doors were sealed, contained with uniformed officers.

D: you have no personal knowledge in terms of the search of June 22nd? No knowledge if anything might have been moved?

A: No, No

D: No attempt to find out the answers?

A: Never occurred to me.

J: Is there to be some kind of continuity issue?

D: Not sure…

C: I wasn't sure the computers would be a concern….

J: We have the officers here…

……

C: I'm not sure how this is relevant.

J: Not sure… it may be relevant… (not clear)

D: Let me ask my next question:

D: Officer did you have any information whether anyone had attempted to access the computers in the first search warrant? Did you make any inquiries?

A: No, No

D: Thank you. You mentioned before you attended the scnee you did some research, some social media sites?

A: yes, yes

D: one think you mentioned… was part of your grounds for seizing the computers… something from hacker news?

A: it helped me get a better understanding of the complexity when it comes to the computers

D: you recall making reference to hackernews? You said something about the fact that Sonne was well regarded… made you feel he had some abilities?

A: Yes

D: TO be clear, as you we redoing research, after midnight, one of the sites you went to was hackernews.com, do you recall that?

A: Yes

D: Do you recall what the details of the information on Hackernews site that caused you to believe he was well regarded?

A: There was some stuff in regard to the G20… the photos on flickr linked back… nexus of connecting.  On the blogs I rmemeber some people praising him for great photos, thanking him, this just from typing in google search for 'toronto goat'. On the internet it will bring up stuff from last year, today… I can't remember which page…

D: You mentioned these links between various ssites… I take it the social media report you prepared… would have contained all relevant info that you found during your search?

A: Yes I did screencaptures on as many photos… onto a word doc.

D: You recall whether you retained anything from hackernews?

A: Not on that website… can't right-click to save, so I tried saving what I could.

D: I'm going to suggest that hackernews was not in any way linked to flickr or torontogoat, and that all that was there was a video newsreel. Would that assist in refreshing?

A: It's a big website, I remember seeing the name 'toronto goat' mentioned…

D: I'm going to read you something fomHackernews.  I'm going to ask if this refreshes your memory.

J: Has this been disclosed?

D: No, but I have good faith

J: Show it ot the crown.

D: There's a video, and what I have is a transcript of the video…

J: At this point you're not setting up for…

D: I want to put a suggestion..

J: If you're using something that is to be used to refresh his memory…

D: At this point what I am reading is just part of my questions.

J : Thank you.

D: What I am suggesting you reviewed was a brief video news report of an individual speaking in a video frame lasting one minute “Toronto goat ake Byron sonne is prettywell known in infosec circles. Holds CISSP, member in hacklab, arrested the other day in what the media says were plans to pass on G20 info and blow up the G20. (list of charges). Coworkers say there's no way he's a terrorist and (something about security theatre), twitter provocateur is the extent of his involvement”. Sound familiar?

A: Never seen that video.

D: I'd like to provide you with a copy of the social media report you prepared… (walks to witness)

D: I'm showing you something… (discussion with crown)

I'd like you to review those and advice if you recognize them as the report you prepared?

A: Yes.

D: Do you have your own copy?

A: I do.

D: Refer to that.  Starts with… a para or two of writing and all these photos obtained from open source… website for flickr account contains 260 items… sep into 15 pages… what follows are Toronto goat flickr page… printed 2 per page… two pages in, some items… photograph of police on university… fence detail, security camera, tree steps…

A: Yes, yes, yes, yes

D: Drywall plugs…

A: Yes

D: A diagram… adevice that looks like a car jack... queens park… boards with holes on them… round item, light in color… some contraption, a long white tube, holes… someone holding something up to the camera… first Canadian place… antennas… steel wool… four photos of a contraption on a workbench… a fan… img_2576… control panel for a microwave… a crystal…  a photo .. . . mumble… cement with caption 'cable in joint'… Toronto goat Youtube channel… screencaptures from a video, G20 fence june 15… that's all that's in your social media report…

A: That's all I was able to save.

D: Nothing in there on Hackernews?

A: No.

D: You understand… that social media are websits that host information for users?

A: yes

D: So flickr… a suer uploads a photograph to flickr and then it'shosted by the website.

A: yes

D: so I could use a blackberry and upload it to social media website, I could then deleteie from the blackberry and it would still be on the website.

A: Right.

D: it's out there in the 'cloud'.

A: yes.

D: Twitter… same sort of thing..peoplemakle comments on twitterand they're accessible on the web.  If I waere to make a comment on twitter on a computer or mobile deviceand turned off the computer, the comment is available for others to see. Because it's public in the web.Rihgjt?

A: Right.

D: one doesn't need to leave… it's not as if people accessing the twitter and flicker and somehow accessing my computer in order to see the images or comments.

A: No.

D: You understand that.

A: Yes.

D: You tube is the same way?

A: Correct.

D: And you understood that on June 23rd 2010.

A: yes

D: Do you understand blogs work the same way? The website hosts the information?

A: yes.

D: Officer… You understand that in addition to the judicial aiuthorization you might have received under a search warrant issued under section 47 under the criminal code… the other powers that you have a police officer to seize items of interest, for example you arrest someone, you have the power to search for evidence relating to the offense.

A: Yes.

D: There may be situations understatutde where you were authorized to conduct a search/seizure without judicial authorization.

A: yes.

D: If there's no time to get a warrant… as long as you have sufficient grounds…

A: yes.

D: Another… seizure power is section 49 of the criminal code. (489?)

D: You undetrstand that when you're executing a warrant that you you may be entitled to seize things that aren't covered by the warrant.

A: Yes

D: Your understanding of the scope of thwpoer to seize things that are not covered?

A: My interpretation of what is necessary….

D: IF something is not listed and you see an item of interest? It has to be necessary to support the charges?

A: If I believe… I didn't write the warrant… that person might have been less articulate.. I'm very particular… I felt that this item here was used in the production of an explosive device…

D: What is the standard that you apply? You see something that is not listed in the warrant… you don't simply say …

A: It's for the best evidence (?)

D: Do you seize something because you think it might be of assistance to the investigation.

A: I believe.(?)

J: In terms of the computer I think we have a different rationale…

(judge calls for a 10 minute recess)

D: I was aking questions before the recess about this power to seize things that aren't covered by warrants and what standards you apply… leaving aside the standards… am I clear in my understanding that you didn't use the power of section 49

A: No

D: You believed they were covered by the search warrant.

A: Yes

D: Now… as scene manager is one of your responsibilities to prepare a report to a justice?

A: No

D: No? I'm showing you something that we've been provided in disclosure… Is that a document that you prepared?

A: Yes, this a report to a justice.

D: And it says at the top… badge #8307… some boxes to be checked off?

A: yes.

D: We see on the 3rd page there's a report to a justice… appendix a, under the heading, seizure with a serch warrant…

A: yes

D: There's a summery at the bottom describing certain offenses… the accused Byron sonne, Kristen Peterson were charged… (continues reading the summary) Numerous items were seized…

D: That's all under the heading 'seizure with search warrant'

A: yes

D: if you go to the first page, it says 'I, officer manaquie, acted under the authority of a warrant'?

A: Yes

A: yes

D: The next box down is not checked, the one that says section 49?

A: No

J: Got it.

D: Officer, You're obviously familiar with this document?

A: Yes

D: This document is something gyou're required to prepare under search and seizure?

A: Yes

D: Whether you seize it under a search warrant, or 49, or some other power… you are require to report to a justice? You have to report it if you take property from a citizen.

A: Yes.

D: In addition this report relates back to the search warrant that you're executing… part of the order that is made,” you are authorized and required… to bring before me or some other justice” criminal code allows you to make a report, instead of physically bringing them.  So by filling out this report you are complying with part of the order.

A: Correct, Yes, Correct.

D: You understand that when a report is made to a justice, it's not just a rubber stamp? They could look at the materials and say 'you should give this back?”

A: Yes

D: Has that ever happened?

A: No.

D: Hold on to things for a period time… have to be under section 49… you have to request for an item for longer..

A: Correct

D: Would you agree with me that what you were telling the court that … on the last page, there's a table of four columns heading 'property tag #' and 'item' 'disposition' nad 'charges laid' and on this report, there's only one line that's been entered, and the tag # is 'see attached list', disposition is 'hold for evidence for court'.

A: Yes.

D: You're telling the court that everything contained in the attached list… was seized under the search warrant.

A: Yes.

D: You're not suggestiong that you used some other power to seize these items.

A: Correct.

D: There was in fact a list?

A: Yes, it was attached.

D: What I'd like to do is… volume one back from you… and grab volume two…turn to tab H… there's an item in the document of that tab… it's got a date, dec 31, 2010… you see it's got FIS-JOB14135-0, would you agree that the document you submitted was as similar list but an earlier version?

A: Yes

D: Take a look… you've got… perhaps we can go… page 16.  There's an item, #101, 'macbook pro', location seized main floor office, date 'june 24th', We then see there's some information about continutity… (reads a bunch of numbers) “Sealed”.

A: Correct

D: It's clear this isn't the document you provided… item 102, envelope and letter Canadian association of rocketry…  There are three versions… one is the date of seizure, and the other is how the items were handled afterwards.

A: right.

A: Yes.

A: Yes.

J: (asks a question about evidence records, says it's already listed)

D: I can move through it quickly…

A: No.

D: Thank you.

D: Officer just one area of verification..you mentioned something about scanned… something to do with the delay of moving the computers from residence… what did the 3D scan involve?

A: it's an investigative tool used at crime scenes, makes a 3D rendering of a room… someone attends with a fancy machine and puts it in the room and it does a scan and they can reproduce it on computer.

D: How long did the scan take?

A: it took a few days.

D: While the scan was being done were any items removed?

A: You're in from June 23 to 27, that'swhats authorized?

D: You say the scan took a few days… that's obviously interfering with your warrant…

A: In regards to the beginning of the scan on the 23rd, we had to wait… for personnel from FIS, he had to get an assistance… the he began scanning just after 5pm. He wasn't able to finish that day. But he did do the scene scan in stages, he did it in certain chunks so we can follow with the search after him.

D: At what point… the computers were seized on june 24th… do you know the time they came to seize the computers?

A: 2:40 PM.

D: And by 5:45pm they had finished their collection? And that's on June 24th, still 3 days left?

A: yes

D: A decision was made to remove the computers rather than search them in the house?

A: Yes.

D: Officer… thank you very much…. In your evidence, my friend was asking you… the reasons you thought the computers were significant.  One of the first things you said was that it had something to do with explosives?

A: Yes. Documentation.

D: Do you recall giving that answer before we even mentioned the social media blogs?

A: I can't recall.

D: We prepared a will-say, recently?

A: Nov 14.

D: Were you provided with a list of questions?

A: No.

D: You were asked to just best recall your involvement?

A: Yes

D: Anyhting specific about computers?

A: No

D: Do you have the will-say with you?

A: Yes.

D: I'm going to suggest to you that you describe the reasons for the seizure ..you make no mention of the explosives. Correct?

A: Uh… No I just sya it's to support the charges.

D: No , you say more than that, you make a reference to social media and Toronto goat blog…

A: used to store the Toronto goat blog…

D: Right.  I take it when you were preparing this will-say it was to be given to the defense?

A: yes.

D: And you were trying to reconstruct what was going through your mind?

A: They were all in my head… with relation to computers..

A: It's a website… just have to keep looking.

D: So you haven't gone back to the website in a year and a half?

A: No.

D: So all we have is your recollection? You agree that your recollection is imprecise?

A: No, you mentioned a video that was about him being arrested…

D: In terms of what was on the site when he was arrested…

A: I remember a bunch of tabs and clicking around… but when I did my search, the things that were real important to me were the photos… I couldn't remember how to get back to the hackernews blog… it's so many layers.

D: Thank you very much officer.
