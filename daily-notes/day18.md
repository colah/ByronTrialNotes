Byron's Trial, Day 18 (Week 4)
==============================

* J: I've reached my position. I'm able to advise counsel of my position on the five outstanding motions:
 * Facial Validity of the warrants: I've concluded that the ITO, excised and amplified, that an issuing Judge could have issued with respect to ... and records relating to the production of explosives. Severability an be applied to the necessary parts.
 * The Crown has satisfied me beyond a reasonable doubt that the first statement to Bui, was voluntary and not tainted. I've found that there was not requirement for rechartering after the 503 submitted violated.
 * I find that part of the second statement was not voluntary. This includes the details about the visa card.
 * 
 * The production order, excised and amplified, including the statement that was not voluntary. A section 8 breach. I find that it could not have been issued, but that the evidence is still admissible under 24(2).
 * Save for the portion of Mr. Sonne's statement I've found not voluntary and what had already been found admissible, everything is allowed into the trial.
 * I'm concerned that Mr. Di Luca did not consider the admissibility of the evidence in the concerns raised.... about the admissibility of the computer evidence... Oullett is not a computer expert... He was clearly speculating...

* C: I have provided the long awaited agreed statement of fact on the trial proper. 
* Some documents that are of a personal nature to Mr. Sonne. For example, all the visa statement of Mr. Sonne and Ms. Peterson... It should be an exhibit, but ...
  * J: Perhaps the Public is only entitled to a summary.
* Photo that it is admitted contains Mr. Sonne and the security fence.
* Mr. Sonne was arrested on a bus. Your honnor has heard evidence that he was in possession of a camera, police scanner, cellphone, a piece of paper. A piece of paper with a criminal code section about preventitive arrest and arrest hotline. It's admitted that paragraph on paper is from the website of the Comunity Solidarity Network.
* Mr. Sonne lived at 58 Elderwood. Searched. Continuity of evidence is admitted. Nature and quantity of Gavid Edmiston, forensic chemist, ... Dr. Anderson based his report on it. The Defense takes no issue with the report.

* It's conceded that Mr. Sonne used two email address blsonne@rogers.com and blsonne@halvan.com (sp?). Mr. Sonne's facebook profile (as available to public). 
* Your honor has heard about Bit Torrent. It's a filesharing tool that shares information peer to peer. A torrent file directs the computer to other computers that contain parts to construct the complete file. Priate bay is a website that hosts torrent files. Mr. Sonne controlled an account, goatmaster.
* Par 11, a blog is the kind of website one can edit any time, by a person or group of persons. Typically, entries are in reverse chronological order. Mr. Sonne had a blog, torontogoat.
* Par 12, Twitter is a social networking website where people can talk on linfe. A tweet is a short post... Tweets are public. Users can follow other users, at which point the user are automatically show the other user's. Anyone can follow anyone else, without permission, though one can block other users. On a user profile, one can click on a hyperlink to see followers and who the user is folowing. Users can add hashtags to tweets, which begin with a number sigh, for example #g20report. Conversations often take place through hashtags. Mr. Sonne had 66 followers at the time of his arrest, 130 (something I didn't catch) now. Crown is not relying on Mr. Sonne's followers. The people Mr. Sonne is following are the same as when he was arrested.
* Flickr is a website where one can put pictures and then use a url beginning http:// that conveniently redirect one to the picture. 
* Par 18, youtube is a website where one can upload and share videos. Each video has a permenant URL beginning http://www.youtube.com . By pasting this link into blogs or...

* Mr. Sonne used his visa credit card to make a number of purchases at the Canadian Tire store. The correspond to descriptions in this spread sheet, prepared by Canadian Tire employees. Your honor will see things like 1x052, that's the skew number and can be looked up in the spreadsheet.
