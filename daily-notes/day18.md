Byron's Trial, Day 18 (Week 4)
==============================

* J: I've reached my position. I'm able to advise counsel of my position on the five outstanding motions:
 * Facial Validity of the warrants: I've concluded that the ITO, excised and amplified, that an issuing Judge could have issued with respect to ... and records relating to the production of explosives. Severability an be applied to the necessary parts.
 * The Crown has satisfied me beyond a reasonable doubt that the first statement to Bui, was voluntary and not tainted. I've found that there was not requirement for rechartering after the 503 submitted violated.
 * I find that part of the second statement was not voluntary. This includes the details about the visa card.
 * 
 * The production order, excised and amplified, including the statement that was not voluntary. A section 8 breach. I find that it could not have been issued, but that the evidence is still admissible under 24(2).
 * Save for the portion of Mr. Sonne's statement I've found not voluntary and what had already been found admissible, everything is allowed into the trial.
 * I'm concerned that Mr. Di Luca did not consider the admissibility of the evidence in the concerns raised.... about the admissibility of the computer evidence... Oullett is not a computer expert... He was clearly speculating...

* C: I have provided the long awaited agreed statement of fact on the trial proper. 
* Some documents that are of a personal nature to Mr. Sonne. For example, all the visa statement of Mr. Sonne and Ms. Peterson... It should be an exhibit, but ...
  * J: Perhaps the Public is only entitled to a summary.
* Photo that it is admitted contains Mr. Sonne and the security fence.
* Mr. Sonne was arrested on a bus. Your honor has heard evidence that he was in possession of a camera, police scanner, cellphone, a piece of paper. A piece of paper with a criminal code section about preventitive arrest and arrest hotline. It's admitted that paragraph on paper is from the website of the Comunity Solidarity Network.
* Mr. Sonne lived at 58 Elderwood. Searched. Continuity of evidence is admitted. Nature and quantity of Gavid Edmiston, forensic chemist, ... Dr. Anderson based his report on it. The Defense takes no issue with the report.
* Dr. Anderson... Defense agrees that he is an expert in organic chemistry...
* It's conceded that Mr. Sonne used two email address blsonne@rogers.com and blsonne@halvan.com (sp?). Mr. Sonne's facebook profile (as available to public). 
* Your honor has heard about Bit Torrent. It's a filesharing tool that shares information peer to peer. A torrent file directs the computer to other computers that contain parts to construct the complete file. Priate bay is a website that hosts torrent files. Mr. Sonne controlled an account, goatmaster.
* Par 11, a blog is the kind of website one can edit any time, by a person or group of persons. Typically, entries are in reverse chronological order. Mr. Sonne had a blog, torontogoat.
* Par 12, Twitter is a social networking website where people can talk on linfe. A tweet is a short post... Tweets are public. Users can follow other users, at which point the user are automatically show the other user's. Anyone can follow anyone else, without permission, though one can block other users. On a user profile, one can click on a hyperlink to see followers and who the user is folowing. Users can add hashtags to tweets, which begin with a number sigh, for example #g20report. Conversations often take place through hashtags. Mr. Sonne had 66 followers at the time of his arrest, 130 (something I didn't catch) now. Crown is not relying on Mr. Sonne's followers. The people Mr. Sonne is following are the same as when he was arrested.
* Flickr is a website where one can put pictures and then use a url beginning http:// that conveniently redirect one to the picture. 
* Par 18, youtube is a website where one can upload and share videos. Each video has a permenant URL beginning http://www.youtube.com . By pasting this link into blogs or... 
* Activity. Mini SoOnCon, a conference hosted by hackerspace. A hackerspace is a place, often a lab or studio, where people can share technology. Mr. Sonne was listed as giving talk "RF countersurveilance..."
* Rocketry correspondence. 
* Visa statements.
* par 23, a receipt from pottery supplies. Mr. Sonne bought 5 plastic jars.
* J: Did you read par 22?
* Oops. No. Mr. Sonne bought 1kg of Zinc Oxide from Tucker's Pottery supplies
* par 23, purchase plastic jars.
* Mr. Sonne used his credit card to buy cold compresses. 
* Mr. Sonne used his visa credit card to make a number of purchases at the Canadian Tire store. The correspond to descriptions in this spread sheet, prepared by Canadian Tire employees. Your honor will see things like 1x052, that's the skew number and can be looked up in the spreadsheet. In some cases, where it is relevant, your honor can see a picture from the Internet of what the product looks like.
* On May 1st, 2010, Mr. Sonne purchased two anodes from American Pyrotechnic Supplies. 
* On Jan 27th, 2010, Mr. Sonne wrote to ... enquiring about the requirements for purchasing ... and was advised a precursor license was needed.
* Package stopped at border for ...
* Mr. Sonne purchased Potasium Permaganate, Ms Cha... wrote to Mr. Sonne informing him that it was a hazardous material and could not be shipped.
* Mr. Sonne used his credit card to purhase one pound of 
* The Crown greatly appreciates the assistance of the defense. These concessions have saved a great deal of time.

 * Yes.
* You've taken advanced courses in photography?
 * Yes.
* You take photos of your card to identify who took the photos?
 * Yes. More a common practice than a procedure. 
* in this investigation?
 * Yes. Myself and other officers.
* Digital photography? Advantages in that you can edit afterward?
 * Yes. You can zoom in more easily...
* There's metadata which is useful?
 * Yes.
* There's information about the camera. And date and time?
 * Yes.
* That tells you what time the photo was taken.
 * Yes. Based on time on the camera.
* It's fair to say that that is roughly the time that the photos were taken on that day?
 * Yes.
* I'm going to go through the photos slowly. Are these the photos you took?
 * Yes.
* You were called in. We were the CBRE team. You were the first forensic identification team. ETF had already gone through the house. 
 * yes.
* But there would be no reason, for, say, them to move somethng across the house?
 * Yes.
 * I took a video, other took photos at around the same time.
* As the search went on, more things were move around.
 * Yes.
* So the best photos for telling how things were originally set out were at the beginning. 
 * Yes.
* (Shows two photos)
* Things are differently arranged. 
  * Yes.
* SO if we want to know where things were, we need to be careful to look at photos early on.
* Garage, photo is what it was like when you entered. Bicycle, drill press, table saw, circular saw...
 * Yes.
* And that fits the genral scene. There's lots of tools.
 * Yes. Hardware related stuff.
* (Later photo) You agree that things are arrange dvery differently in this photo.
 * Yes.
* Do you recognize these chemicals?

  * No.
* And the other bottle?
  * I can see that it says student on it, but I can't read the rest.
* The bottles of acetone and he... weren't seized and we don't know how much was in those containers?
  * Yes.
* Cupboards are open, bins with lids off. That might be the ETF?
  * Yes.
* You don't know one way or another, but that would be consistant with their job.
  * Especially if they were concerned about safety.

* Drillbits?
 * Yes.
* Pieces of hardware, arranged by the nature of the hardware?
 * I can't speak to the arrangement...
* Items that are adhesive related.

* You use it to make electronics. To connect wires and attach things to a circuit board?
 * That would be a fair description.
* Wood workinf supplies?
 * yes.

* Top of the desk beside the shelving unit?
 * Yes. The lab desk.
* There's jars behind the desk. The appear to have some sort of liquid in them. You didn't seize them. Did you look inside them?
 * Yes. I looked at them.
* This is a photo of a blue crystal. Did you see anything like that in the container?
 * It's the same color.
* If I suggested that they were growing crystals like that...
 * I wouldn't be able to say, other than that they're the same color.
* Did you ever grown crystals in high school?
  * No.

(In recess till tomorrow, Byrne may not be here for most of it. Will probably be part day.)
 * I could only say that ehy were the same color.
