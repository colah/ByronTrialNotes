Byron's Trial, Day 15 (Week 4)
==============================

(Thanks to lnunan)

Crown: (Byrne, continuation of yesterday)

* Does it matter that the officer misconstrued uh- misconceived the specific authority under which the officer sized the computer if he seized the computer under reasonable probable grounds under by applying the proper standard 489

* Case: Police officer gets a warrant, seizes a bandage, turns out the warrant is invalid, the court of appeal rules that the seizure was still legal

* Case: The police cannot rely that a legit purpose for the search existed if the police did not rely on that purpose for their search

* Draws a distinction between purpose and authority -> in our case the police seized under the wrong authority but with a legitimate purpose

* More Case law… Purpose vs authority

* Police arrested someone they believed to be selling or buying marijuana, officer searched car because of rcmp policy to search all impounded cars, had they been legitimately searching for the purpose of discovering evidence the seizure of evidence would have been legit

* Judge: Expresses scepticism of the distinction Crown is drawing

* Crown: given what we have on the record, Manikey (sp?) is seizing under reasonable and probable grounds, and all that is missing is the label 480-9 which even my friend agrees isn't enough to

* Nothing I am putting before the court is offensive or runs afoul of the supreme court, that circumvents any charter rights

* Moving to 24-2, even if the court rejects what I said and decides the seizure was a violation there is no reason to exclude the evidence

* The police are legitimately in his house when they seized the computer, so it cannot be a serious breach that they seized it

* J:You're saying that even if the police

* If the physical box is not properly seized, you still have authority to search the contents under the warrant, we don't have a but for

* J: I still have to deal with the seizure of the data

* C:The search of the contents of this the most important thing, I think we can agree that it's not the physical box  that matters.

* Complains about being sick

* J: question

* C: To the extent that so and so says that you can wholesale search a computer blackberry etc… has been entirely supplanted by jones

* Question of cursory searches is theoretical, if you're looking at an email or a photo you can get a good look at a glance, even a video you'll get a good idea if something is relevance

* It's not like he was looking for evidence of some other crime, if they had seized something that lead to another charge then this might be a live issue.

* To the extent that items were excluded from the ITO because there was no evidence that they would found at the location, and then when they arrive at the location and low and behold the items are there, there is no reason they cannot seize them under 489, and insofar as Wo(sp?) disagrees it is wrongly ruled

* This is not an attempt to circumvent prior judicial authority

* I'm sort of loath to bring up this issue, how far is Ouellette permitted to go in formulating his approach

* J: Does it depend on what we mean by related to the case?

* C: Ouellette had to give the terms a reasonable interpretation, which could be broad, so long as it is reasonable

* To the extent that he was looking for circumstantial evidence, not a gun etc.

* Police has discretion as to how if not what is searched

* Ouellette is entitled to thing about how to search

* These (search terms) were starting places, they were leads

* A lot of the mental complexity arises from the fact that we are necessarily looking for circumstantial evidence

* Complaining about being sick

* To the extent that the court accepts my friends position if Ouellette went too far he did not go wildly too far

* J: If the evidence is not excluded then issues of relevance are still alive at the trial

* C: I think the basis on which we want to proceed is based on his general approach, I don't think we need to go through every file

* J: agrees

* C: Even if you accept my view on mental processes, my friend would say that he was doing it according to the wrong constitutional standard

* I have notes on a particular exchange between my friend and Ouellette, about half way through my notes ob the cross

* My friend asks Ouellette Q: was it in your mind that some of the things that you were bookmarking were not in the warrant? A: Absolutely. RPGs that they would afford evidence of offences on the warrant. Q: Were you not simply bookmarking things that seemed relevant to the case. A: No

* To the extent that he said could or might then I admit that there is a problem

* J: I guess he was bookmarking files that he hadn't read yet, there can't have been RPGs

* C: Exactly, formulating a lead vs actually executing the warrant 

Defence (Copeland) 

* Manikey was consistent throughout the interview that he was operating under the warrant

* J: The warrant clearly doesn't say seize, but it does say search for records, but they make it was clear it was impractical

* D: I submit they couldn't in this case, we know that they know there are computers in this case, so it can't have been a question that they didn't know they would find them

* Plain view requirement that it be immediately apparent that the item be criminal in nature, this must apply to individual items not a collection of items ie: all the computers

* When it gets into 489 we are looking at exceptions to the policy of prior judicial authority

* "The question of whether a thing would afford evidence should be made on a thing by thing basis" to seize an entire class of thing is too great an exception

* And at it's highest Manikey's evidence was that he thought it might afford evidence

* Case: Scientology they seized an entire filling cabinet and eventually returned 25% of the files, rules as too broad a seizure

* If the police decide the search allowed by the warrant is impractical they cannot just decide to do something else, it is a serious breach

* Plain view: inadvertence argument is relevant

* Specific narrow classes of records

* 487 contained specific statutory provisions for searches of this sort

* The warrant allowed a search for specific files in a restricted time period which may itself be a way of balancing the right to privacy

* J: As I understand the cases the officer was entitled to search the entire computer for record pertaining to the production of explosives

* I submit that Jones says the opposite. There are very specific email transmissions between specific addresses, and images of…

* They weren't allowed to search for videos, they aren't allowed to search for just any email

* J: A record could be a photo, a video, anything… How am I supposed to decide what types of files can be a record.

* D: List of types of files that can be searched doesn't contain video or photos…

* This ties to my friends submission that he would have searched everything, regardless of the conspiracy charge

* Jones supports the idea that it was valid only because it was a very narrow search for specific types of files, Jones does not stand for the idea a computer is an indivisible object

* If in every case the police can say I have to look at each and every file then Jones is meaningless and a computer is an indivisible object

* The cursory review must be limited by the narrow scope of the warrant

* They were not authorized to search every file but just the images and files that could contain emails

* Even though the warrant doesn't specify types of files but it does specify types of evidence, which by implication restricts the types of files

* J: The court found that there was no restriction on the type of file you can search for

* D: Disagrees

* The point is of Jones is that one cannot look at every item on the computer, one must look at the types of evidence of the computer

* J: I'll have to look at it

* D: Case: Was the search truly incident to arrest, the police must turn their mind to scope of the search. The search cannot be said to be authorized because although an authorized search could have been made that was not the search that was made 

* J: I want to ask one more question: What type of file do you say Ouellette opened that he ought not to have?

* D: This comes from the crown's submission that even without the conspiracy that Ouellette would have been entitled to examine the entire computer.

* In appendix a) in this case there is a list of items/types of items, in the last clause it says blah blah blah that can be stored electronically or on paper, so we must be looking at evidence that could be stored on paper.

* If we take out the word electronically and restrict ourselves to the physical world then I submit that we could not have been looking at vhs cassettes.

* I submit that the approach that Ouellete was taking is the approach in Giles not in Jones, the approach that was rejected in Jones that the computer is an indivisible object

* Ouellette's approach that he could look at anything that was relevant to the case

* Case: Judge stated that the police could not search for anything that was relevant.

* Reasonable grounds to believe that in any receptacle, building, place… that there will be anything that will afford evidence… then the receptacle etc. may be searched that

* In Jones, what focuses the search, makes it tailored, reasonable, restrained is the narrow terms of specific items. Any items not in the warrant old not be searched for, one could not seize anything that was not on the warrant under the warrant. If in the narrow search allowed by the warrant they came across some other evidence then there is a power to seize under another power but there is no justification of a broader search.

* Once it is not in the warrant then we have to apply the standards of plain view and 489

* There must be in the officers mind reasonable grounds to believe that it will afford evidence

* My friends example of checking for keys when looking for a truck, my friend calls this creativity, but it is not a creativity that is to be encouraged. Court ordered are to be strictly followed. To be creative it is look for things that are not on the warrant, no search for

* J: What of this distinction between direct vs circumstantial evidence

* D: I'm not advancing that evidence. My friend says that there is nothing unconstitutional about looking for  circumstantial evidence, which is true, but what is unconstitutional is looking for anything that is not named on the warrant.

* If one follows my friend's logic there would be no point in having a list of items to be searched for because the officer would be permitted to look for any evidence of the alleged crimes.

* If the honour finds that the officer was not applying the standard and was simply applying the relevance standard…

* It creates big problems when the bulk of the evidence is seized under 489, which is an exception to the rule of prior judicial authority

* Lee did a thorough if not complete review and made a collection of bookmarks he was not applying a standard of RPGs

* It is telling that Ouellette only removed a few bookmarks that were clearly irrelevant, from the non-RPG selections of Lee

* The date limitation in Jones is relevant to the timestamp on the files

* Jones is saying that if you are looking for conduct that happened at a particular time

* To the extent that there is reference to a time limitation it is in reference to that and not to a time limitation on the warrant 

Crown:

* The word information is pretty broad.

* Information that can be stored electronically or on paper, or is disjunctive

* Not a reasonable argument that records must be storable on both to be valid

J: Question of onus, crown has conceded that items were not seized under the warrant, Mr Copeland says you must item by item argue that the seizure under 489 was valid.

C: He is acting on a standard of RPGs whether under the warrant or under 489 generally and if you agree with my submission on his general approach then there's no problem. There are thousands of items and it is not my role to anticipate any possible attack on any piece of evidence.

* There is nothing inherent in the types of evidence being sought that would limit the  

Defence:

* Factual: only return to a justice was with respect to the physical computer, not the information 

Production Orders
----------------

Defence: (DiLuca)

* Case Waruk, relates to seizing or re-seizing arguments

* Some issues but no attack on warrant (to resize items seized on arrest?)

* Two production orders, on same ITO

* One to Visa, one to Rogers (cell phone)

* Nothing pursuant to cell phone is sought to be tendered but it's relevant to a global 24-2

* If your honour quashes the first warrant then insofar as the information is the same as is on this ITO then this one automatically falls

* The offences for which this warrant is sought do not include any count of intimidation of a justice official,

* Include: mischief, attempt to mischief

* Offences are listed as completed (past tense)

* No evidence of first three offences.  

* ITO, par. 11 should be excised, and 16

* In par. 11 there is a clear connection in Waruk's mind between the initial stop and the commencement of the investigation.

* In par. 16 "based on the incident described above" (june 15) the TPS directed the JIG to direct their attention to B. Sonne. 

* J: Sonne drew attention of Ms. Bann and Knight? So…

* My argument will be that in Waruk's mind and the issuing justice's mind the Knight and Ban reports came out of the June 15 stop.

* The excision in this case includes the Ban and Knight information, in the absence of amplification

* J: Can I consider the evidence given in the previous motions here?

* D: Yes. But there would have to be argument as to whether

* Points out the highlighted areas of the warrant (highlighted because they should be excised)

* It's the surveillance that suggests the use of the credit card.

* Sonne is asked about the credit card by Bui a statement

* If your honour finds a 10-B violation it is automatically excised

* If you find that the statement is involuntary it likely engages a section 7 violation

* In the alternative I take the position that an involuntary statement is unlawful and if not a specific

* Wiebe (Alberta) Judge states plainly that in view of the fact that it the statement is involuntary it will be excised.

* Singh, does not state that there will always be a section 7 violation under a case of involuntary statement but that there is a significant overlap and that they will often follow

* Also, the statement was taken in violation of section 9 (24hrs to get before a justice issue)

* J: You're saying that I can consider the evidence on record but in order to amplify I need to go through the same process.

* "The fact the htmd…" whether you find that it should be excised or amplified it is unlikely that it would affect the finding of whether you could have issued the warrant.

* J: So even if the surveillance is out if the statement is in then there is a connection between the chemicals and the credit card?

* D: Yes, except if Bui is tainted by the surveillance and that's why he's asking about it.

* Portions relevant to potato cannons etc. are excised.

* The list of items seized included books and documents describing how to make of rockets and explosives

* Only books are: Encyclopedia, Understanding Physics (both books mr cropland owns), Codes and Cyphers, Sneaky Uses For Everyday Things

* Some paragraphs are editorializing or overstating

* Reference to something on TorontoGoat blog, that is made out to be about explosives when it's clearly about the wave guide

* J: Doesn't suggest deliberate attempt to mislead on the part of Waruk although if it is ultimately misleading then it come out

* D: Comment by Kristen re: don't blow up the house is clearly related to waveguide

* pg 17 relates to grounds for each production order

* Cell phones:

* Viewing usage logs will provide proof of who was posting items to the internet and when

* 1) No evidence that Sonne was posting from a phone

* and 2) No evidence that the phone in question was capable of posting items to the internet

* Will show lists of other co-conspirator, rely on earlier ruling re: lack of evidence of co-conspirators

* Will be able to pinpoint .

* D: It's hard to fault Waruk on it, but a state actor's actions cannot be so neatly parsed.

* J: It would seem unfair to count the surveillance as multiple breaches, I don't know that you punish, well not punish,

* D: Eg: worst case scenario if the police beat a confession out of someone and then another officer writes a perfect warrant that is full, fair, franc etc.  you still

* J: The affiant is relying on information that came before but did't act in bad faith themselves, it's the fruit of the poison tree

* D: A warrant that relies on information obtained via charter breach has a compounding effect on the initial breach because it causes the  effects of the breach to project forwards into other charter projected areas.

* J: Right…

* D: In Grant the warrant is valid but

* In Coté there are valid warrants in the midst of a number of breaches and- 

Crown:

* "I will actually be brief"

* I agree with my friend that if the statement is out and the ban/knight issue cannot be amplified then the issue warrant cannot have been issued

* 1) It is a small error, similar to the error in the first warrant

* J: What is?

* C: To French's linking between the initial stop and the surveillance

* There is no advantage to the police in making the connection between the initial stop and the internet research

* It would be more compelling if he had said the truth, that Sonne had independently come to the attention of the police through his internet activities

* There is no hint of a reason for conflating these things

* J: Do you agree that this has to stand on the 4th count?

* C: 1, 2 and 3 are out, the weapons dangerous are arguable

* At the end of the day, as long as we have count 4 in there

* We do have one live count, without deciding count 5

* If the statement is gone it's entirety I agree that it falls

* All of my friends' involuntariness arguments rest on the lack of a meaningful choice so if it's involuntary then it's necessarily a section 7 breach

* Tainting is too remote by the time Bui is questioning Sonne about homedepot, there is a logical connection but

* J: "Maybe I'm being too logical with the logic but…" If there is a direct connection made to the surveillance. If it's just a vague reference to home depot then I don't see a problem, but you're saying

* C:It is not relentless and eternal, you don't get to keep seeking a remedy, at some point you are just too far removed.

* Loss of this evidence would be important thought not fatal to the crowns case. The case rests on circumstantial evidence and becomes weaker with every loss of evidence.

* It does not amount to no privacy impact, but it is not a significant blow to a significant privacy interest. This does not strike to his dignity as a human being.

* I won't disagree that

* J: The production order is the product of prior breaches, it is not a new breach. It's a new infringement on his privacy.

* C: The original error here is

* At the end of the day I could make the same argument I made with respect to the statement with the surveillance here, I won't, but I could.

* Not to be presumptuous but I'm confident that you'll make the same amplification findings as in the last warrant. 

Defence:

* Debates the issue of where the law the C. is arguing comes from (suggests Chang)

* The privacy interests were different in those cases, here we are only dealing with Sonne's interests.

* Found reference to homedepot in statement transcript, it's not a clear reference to surveillance 

Adjourned until Friday at 10.
