Byron Trial Notes, Day 19 (Week 4)
==================================

(I missed the first few minutes because of a line outside the courthouse:

* Bottles of acid had been moved
* PVC pipes with caps had been moved from a bin of used PVC pipe.
* Hexamine tablets were with the stove
* Stove had discoloration that it wouldn't get from burning gas.
* One could have burnt hexamine tablets on the stove. Could have caused the discoloration.

)

* Have you ever modified a power supply in this manner?
 * No.
* So a PC power supply takes 120V and turns it into a variety of voltages for components of your computer
 * Usually there are plugs for parts of the computer.
* So, you have some familiarity with this?
 * Yes.
* (Next picture) Speaker box and amplifier?
 * Yes
* Packages of seeds?
 * Yes.
* Some of them are torn open?
 * Yes. Most of them are. Can't quite see, but most of them are.
* (Next picture) Cork-board above the desk?
  * Yes
* (Next picture) Two bags of seeds on the cork-board?
  * Yes, In zip lock bags.
* And while you can't make out all the text, there appears to be "sister corn"?
 * Yes.
* And a picture of a corn plant, and information.
 * Yes.
* Now, were you aware Mr. Sonne gave a statement?
 * Yes.
* Did you know what it was?
 * No.
* Did you know he'd indicated that some of the chemicals were for gardening?
 * Later.
* But you took pictures of the gardening?
 * No. We focused inside.
* To your recollection, there was extensive gardening?
 * Some sort of garden.
* But you took no photos?
 * No.
* Took no soil samples?
 * No, sir.
* (Next picture) Plastic bag with electronics on it. Didn't try to determine what it was?
 * No. Just noted what the text was and took a picture.
* Do you see a Liquid Crystal Display?
 * I can see it where your cursor is?
* That didn't assist you in determining what it was?
 * No.
* (Next picture) Picture of workbench?
 * Yes.
* This is more or less how the desk was when you started?
 * Yes.
* Later there were other objects on the desk, that's not how it was when you started?
 * No.
* There's some sort of hose? I'm going to zoom in... Would you agree they were sprinkler heads?
 * I thought they were from an aquarium, actually.
* But if I suggested...
 * Could be.
* Part sticks into the ground, other part sends the water in all directions...
 * I can't comment.
* (Next picture) Area under the workbench?
 * Yes.
* And you agreed yesterday that the lid may have been on initially?
 * I can't say one way or another.
* Some tools?
 * A laser level...
* This is a bin you might have to take with you somewhere?
 * Yes. It's portable.
* Electronic components?
 * Yes.
* And there's the baggie with nichrom wire?
 * Yes.
* And the anti-static bag is also in there?
 * I believe it was in one of the drawers.
* But, in any event, it was not on top of the desk?
 * No, we put it there.
* (Next picture) What you described hose with an air compressor fittings?
 * Yes.
* You recognize the fittings?
 * Yes.
* Do you have an underground sprinkler system at your house?
 * No.
* Based on your common sense, could it be used to fit an air compressor to a sprinkler system to clear water in the winter?
 * Could be.
* Does that change your opinion about it being unusual?
 * No.
* (Next picture) Bin of gardening supplies?
 * Yes.
* That would be consistent with what I suggested?
 * Yes.
* In this room, there were things related to all sorts of technological endeavors?
 * Yes. Electronics, chemicals...
* (Next picture) The furnace room. What you described as an electrochemical cell?
 * Actually, I described it as a container of liquid with wires attached.
* (Next picture) Picture of same device.
 * Yes.
* Were you familiar with this sort of object?
 * No. I recognize some things. The multimeters, a power supply, a thermometer. 
* Multimeter is the thing at the top?
 * Yes.
* J: Is that the same thing as the voltmeter?
* D: Perhaps officer could explain?
 * It can measure voltage and other things...
* The power supply had been turned off?
 * ...
* What do they read?
 * Left one is 0 and the right is 1.
* Right is at V?
 * Can't read.
* But that would indicate voltage?
 * Yes.
* And left is at a?
 * Can't read it.
* That would indicate amperage?
 * Current...
* The power supply would be running current through the bin?
 * Yes.
* And the multimeters were monitoring that?
 * Yes.
* Do you recall that you found a similar lid in the storage room?
 * Yes.
* Do you recall that one of the things was a label "chlorine venting"
 * Yes.
* And that was similar to the vent on this?
 * No markings about chlorine on this one.
* (Next picture) This is what the storage room looked like at first?
 * Yes.
* Lid was at the back, to the right?
 * Yes.
* You described it as a storage room, and that's consistent with how this object was found?
 * Yeah, it was in the room.
* (Next picture) PVC object?
 * Yes.
* You described it as a potato cannon?
 * Yes. Suspected potato cannon.
* People use the for recreation?
 * Yes.
* You would stuff object inside and then build up air pressure.
 * Maybe...
* There might be other ways, but as you understand it...
 * Yes.
* Now there's a hole, that would prevent air pressure from building up?
 * I thought that would be for igniting something.
* Certainly, if it was to become a potato cannon, it would need to be modified.
 * Yes.
* It tapers down on one end and is open?
 * Yes.
* To be clear, as you understand a potato cannon, you wouldn't have been able to fire it?
 * I don't know, I didn't try.
* But certainly from you understanding of how they work, that wouldn't.
 * You'd need a projectile. And a way to propel it.
* All right officer. Going back to that last photo...
* From your understanding of how a potato cannon works, it couldn't work on the right side since it is closed off?
 * No.
* And the left hand side has a smaller whole...
 * Yes.
* So the part where the potato would go is missing?
 * Yes. The barrel was missing.
* (Next picture) This is a picture of the office?
 * Yes.
