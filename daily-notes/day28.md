Byron Trial, Day 28 (Week 7)
============================

**Summary:**  Crown makes their closing argument.

***************

* Crown: 3 things:
 * I'll be making submissions first, given the circumstantial nature of the case
  * Judge: OK
 * Regarding the harddrive: given that all the relevant material from the harddrive is filed elsewhere and it contains confidential information, it should be sealed..
 * Received call from Mr. Supinski's council; he was concerned about the accuracy of a response to an email... He didn't recall the nature of his response to the "tickling the dragon" thread, upon refreshing his email with the response this evening. He did not in fact respond about Zigbee's antenas but the 'microwave gun'.
* Judge: I confirmed the thumbdrive works on my computer.
* Judge: Are any of the other exhibits no longer relevant?
* Judge: We have the tweets from the torontogoat account, followed by it, but not the those received?
 * Defense: I think it is a matter of what was in the file. A user can tweet, can follow other accounts (in which case it would appear in the file). To the extent there were other tweets in the hashtag that were not by followed users, we wouldn't see that.
 * Judge: What about responses to tweets from the torontogoat account? There's not suggestion they would be here?
 * Defense: Only those that were followed?
 * Judge: So, if someone was responding to Mr. Sonne, it would only appear if he was following them?
 * Defense: Yes.
* Judge: Another question... From the ASF, it is agreed that for the purposes of this trial, that it is not possible to determine when a website was first visited and it is possible that it could have been visited and we don't see it. That seems to simple, so I want to confirm...
 * Defense: Yes. (goes into more detail about the way data is stored in firefox)
* Judge: Those are my questions. You can begin your closing submissions....

********************

* According to the Canadian Criminal Code, it is illegal to posses without lawful intent, the proof of which rests on them, where it defines explosives very widely, including explosive substances or things intended to be used... 
* Webster defines it as something that, on heat, friction or impact, undergoes rapid decomposition by combustion, producing more stable substances and gas with pressure.
* In day 1 of doctor Anderson's evidence... 
* The Crown submits that you can consider a rocket engine an explosive substance by that definition.
* Judge: I have a transcript of Dr. Anderson's evidence...
* I have prepared a chronology to help show the Crown's...
* Judge: I'd like an electronic copy to, if possible...
* Crown: I'll email it to you and CC council?
* Council agrees.
* Judge: It doesn't need to be an exhibit.
* Proving that Mr. Sonne intended to make an explosive device.
* Mr. Sonne clearly had the substances, materials, equipment, and skills... 
* Making rocket fuel would not be a lawful excuse.
* Mr. Sonne did not find himself with these possessions by accident. He is clearly aware.
* In his statement, when talking to Tam Bui, ... Byron: because I want't to prove I never had ill intent... I never a finished explosive...
* It's telling that Mr. Sonne used the word explosive?
* Judge: Was he the first to use the word explosive?
* No...
* Later, he is asked, if he has the elements that could be turned into an explosive device. He says he wouldn't going to...
* Later, asked if he understands they could be assembled into an explosive device, and he said maybe, that would be a...
* Mr. Sonne says he was making rocket fuel. But there is no evidence that ANFO, TATP, and ... can be used as rocket fuel.
* Many of the chemicals are pointed out to have lawful uses... There is little case law, but there is a decision from he British Columbia youth division. I'll also be referring to Virginia vs ... from 2009.
 * The violet case; there was a voir dire on the admissibility of explosive testing... The case refers to an explosive substance as "anything that is capable of exploding" and the definition in the criminal code substances that can be assembled into an explosive device. 
 * In the other case, where the substance were found in the accused room, he was...
* Judge: So, your position is that having the substances required to make an explosive device is sufficient?
* Crown: You'd also have to find intent.
* Judge: My understanding of Dr. Anderson's evidence was that the components that could be made into an explosive are things like acetone, drano... that would be in our garage
* Judge: The fact of the matter is, we all have substances in our home that can be, with heat or friction... like an aerosol can.
* Judge: The rocket engine is related to the Potassium Chlorate being turned into a rocket engine, which is enough to be an explosive devie?
* Crown: Once I establish intent to build an explosive device, it would be illegal. 
* Judge: The crown would need to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was making a rocket engine, then that it was an explosive, and then onus would shift to...
* Crown: The Potassium Chlorate... if you waited for me to finish before asking questions might be clearer... It is the Crown's possession...
* Judge: The charges Mr. Sonne faces possessing 4 different explosive substances. Clearly he didn't so the Crown needs to establish intent to make them... I just wanted to be clear, since the rocket engine caught me off guard.
* Crown: Yes...

**Break**

* Defense: Just to clarify the clarification to Twitterpod. Your honor mentioned replies to torontogoat. My understanding is that there are two different things. The first is replies to hashtags, which wouldn't be in the database unless it was someone Mr. Sonne was following. There are also tweets with "@torontogoat" which would be a direct response. We do not have whether those would be in the twitterpod data in the ASF.
* Judge: OK. But ones Mr. Sonne was following...
* Defense: And for completeness, a tweet could be both. 

***************

* Crown: For a circumstantial case like this...
* The Crown does not have to prove when Mr. Sonne would have used the bomb, or whether he was going to set one off. Like possession of a firearm doesn't require it to be used.
* Judge: I'm not sure that analogy follows, since it was components. That would correspond to, say, having TATP.
* He did have TATP, it just wasn't assembled.
* I just need to show that he had the materials for the purpose of making it.
* I don't need to show he was going to, just that he intended the materials for the purpose...
* ...
* Computers are a good biography of people.
* His radoiwave gun project demonstrates that he has projects with somewhat questionable intent...
* He emails hacklab saying that he was in a "civily to disobedient move"
* He was fascinated by bombs, guns...
* The evidence doesn't suggest he was particularly political. He was looking for an outlet that would accept his ...
* ...
* He has the skill to hide what he is doing. He talks about doing stuff from other peoples wireless, and the encrypted portions of his harddrive... Imagine what they must be, given what he had publicly on the pirate bay?
* Judge: What inference can I draw?
* The RCMP has been working for months and can't open it!
* Judge: That just says he had a good encryption program. 
* ...
* Judge: It could just be highly personal.
* They're big. And there's two files named after bodies of water in Denmark.
* It seems quite odd that a man who documents like he was...
* ...
* This is an intelligent man. If he was acting a legitimate purpose, why would he have volatile chemicals in a residential area...
* ...
* He posts assassination politics and blogs about it. 
 * Blog post talking about implementation of assassination politics.
* We know Mr. Sonne was having troubles with getting work. We know he had a good relationship with his wife and was concerned for her.
* Judge: That undercuts your suggestion that it was unreasonable for him to do this at his house. In fact, I made a finding of fact like that...
* He thought he was 
* In his chat with aonomus, there's paranoia and they're talking about a bunker in the woods. A lot like the Turner Diaries.
* From the tickling the dragon thread, that Mr. Sonne likes to poke the limit.
* I anticipate the Defense arguing that this is why he was doing this... If you think that through, it doesn't make a lot of sense. If you're doing this to raise flags, it would follow logically -- and Mr. Sonne is a logical man -- that, at some point, you push far enough someone comes to your door. If you're ordering Potassium Permangenate, why would you keep it? Why wouldn't you put a disclaimer? Why wouldn't you tell people?
* You risk your life, your freedom, your marriage... 
* Judge: With the tweet referring to raising flags, do you know which chemical that was referring to?
* We'll go through the chronology later...
* You'd think that once he was told you can't get the potassium permangenate, he'd have stopped, but he went on.
* Mr. Sonne talks about being a "DIY guy"
* Potato cannon.
* On the flickr account, your honnor can see only two contacts hacklab and g20report. And there are pictures of pretty much every camera in the city!
* Judge: I don't know that there's been evidence about what percent they were.
* OK. Over a hundered pictures.
* Why would he do that? He talked to Bui and said he wanted to take pictures of cameras that should be taken down.
* Why would you publish a security vulnerability? Why not wait until afterwards or tell those involved?
* Why did he take a picture of the embassy? Why would he take a picture of the Hilton? Not illegal, but suspicious.
* He was anxious to talk to people about the G20.
* We know he can hijack other peoples wifi and do things he doesn't want others to know about?
* Judge: That's from?..
* From the chat with chaz.
* From the unallocated space -- things that were deleted but not overwritten -- there was a page from a book on shaped charges.
* A wide range of documents on, but none on rocketry.
* Doesn't really do much on twitter. He wanted to be involved in hacklab, but forgot about it. Got reinvolved for G20.
* Jude: This is hacklab chat?
* Yes. There's the hashtag g20report.
* None of the exhibits relating to rocketry are before may... Late...
* He joins CAR and NAPAS, but he doesn't have a rocket! What would be the possible reason for joining a rocketry group, unless you...
* He has bookmarks for g20resist, jihadist forums... It lends to Mr. Sonne is an anarchist. We have political freedom in this country, but Mr. Sonne is obsessive. It seems to be a relatively new alignment, previously he said "fuck the Tamil protesters..."
* Judge: That was the day they took over the road...
* ...
* Mr. Sonne joined the Student Activist Network. 
* He describes himself as an anarchist...
* He said he voted for Harper and that that probably lost him friends amongst certain groups... Now, that's probably everyone, but in context that was probably referring to anarchists...
* ..
* There is a callout on the TCMN list like "let's shut down the places, ideas..." 
* Mr. Sonne tried to recruit hacklab.
* It's always puzzled me why peaceful protesters would be concerned about cameras if they are concerned about police abuse.
* Judge: There's a privacy concern?
* Yes. But it's of interest to protesters.
* Judge: But that could be related to ...
* Certainly. On its own you could...
* He referred to riots in advance of the G20... Certainly people in policing expected that, but the average person wasn't.
* Judge: I'm not sure of that...
* This is a big shift from previous lifestyle...
* We also know about a fascination bordering on obsession with guns. He talks about guns...
* He has a PI license and a synergistic effect...
* Judge: He talked about hunting?
* Chats about... 
* Talks about whether he needs to talk about his anxiety issues...
* He took his air-rifles home over the winter to work on them.
* Judge: air-files or potato cannons?
 * ...
* There are also a significant number of articles on converting weapons.
* Mr. Sonne uploaded a document, "setting fires with electrical timers"
* All the last access date tells us is the last date. I think it was a backup...
* Judge: He couldn't have accessed them of...
* We have no way of knowing is that he hasn't gone through them nightly every day before then...
* documents with instructions on making different explosives...
 * ..
 * weaponized rockets
* Judge: What are the dates for these?
 * All the same.
* ...
* I'll get to Mr. Supinski's evidence later...
* Mr. Sonne starts his torontgoat blog and the "magnetron deathray". He shelves it, the next day he posts photos of antennas.
* We don't know who followed it?
* Judge: What are you suggesting? That it wasn't shelved?
* Beyond that Mr. Supinski was... reluctant to divulge that it was intended to disrupt telecommunications.
* On sept 30th, Mr. Sonne orders a book online, "Ragner's guide to recreational use of ... explosives" Then he uploads a PDF.
* Then the Toronto Goat email.
* Uploads TSA screening manual...
* Next day, uploads the truecrypt document...
* Judge: I thought truecrypt was the program he used to encrypt...?
* Yes. 
* Judge: Then I'm confused by the word document.
* Mr. Sonne buys an ASP baton...
* Sept23, Mr. Sonne joins TCMN
* Sept ..., man attempts to ignite an explosive device of potassium permangenate.
* Can't get potassium permangenate at two locations, gets it at a third.
* Bookmarks...
* Judge: Do I know the contents of the bookmarks, or just the titles...
* Crown: No.
* (Defense whispers)
* Crown: I apologize, all the bookmarks will be in the ASF documents.
* Judge points out rocketry document.
* That could be a variety of things. 
* ...
* Crown tries to find the document to clarify, but then can't find it.
* Judge: I can look it up.
* Crown will look for it at the lunch break.
* Then Sonne makes three bookmarks: lab glassware, lab equipment, and ...
* The same day Mr. Sonne receives a quote for hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid.
* Then gets... and hexamine tablets.
* Judge: Hexamine tablets are the only you're relying on?
* Yes.
* Then the gun scope gets turned back at the boarder.
* More chemistry bookmarks and hydroponics.
* A bookmark about synthesis of ...
* Buys more fuel tablets
* Then uploads shots of damage done by the potato cannon.
* ... photo of graphite rod.
* Buys anodes
* Crown: There may be an error in the chronology...
* ...
* Clearly without a technical explanation it describes perchlorate practices...
* Research into the process it is proceeding
* Mr. Sonne tries to buy potassium chloride salt (water softener)...
* Buys salt at Canadian Tire.
* Uploads a photo of the potassium chloride.
* Experimental rocketry site.
* "Involved in advanced amateur rocketry for the lulz..."
* He talks about burying a storage container in his yard.
* He's talks with chaz.
* picture of the mechanical press.
* Asks again for the CAR link.
* Emails about producing explosives license.
* Still tries to produce potassium chlorate later.
* judge: where's the evidence of that?
* Anderson

**Lunch**

(Group of police officers file in, stand at back of court room)

* Before I continue on... I said Jan 19 Mr. Sonne made a bookmark, but actually he made a bookmark folder.
* We left off at June 8, there was a chat with Fredrick from hacklab about CAR and Mr. Sonne's displeasure with having to license.
* ...
* June 12th Mr. Sonne tweets about videoing the fence line.
* Pictures of cameras
* June 15 stopped by police. Then he tweets "can anyone post a picture of the pass..."
* Next day posts photos of cameras, US embassy, queens park...
* Assuming encrypted... will be used by certain segments of the security forces only...
* Tweets about RF countersurveillance presentation.
* Tweets with link to photos.
* "almost every policey looking camera..."
* "Some cameras may be easy to interfere with, check it"
* One photo of the fence.
* Also posts Practical Pyrotechnics to pirate bay.
* Bought Zinc Oxide, plastic jars.
* This fits with the Crown theory that he, despite knowing he couldn't make rocket fuel, was...
* Judge: Do we know zinc oxide is related to fuel?
* Crown: I'll get to chemicals later...
* Judge: Oh, it makes smoke.
* Then tweets: "This would be good for scaling the fence..."
* "Not to mention they'd help people get a good grip..."
* "Remember, 151 front street is the most important telecommunication..."
* "Don't forget design flaw in G20 security fence..."
* "See, tiny holes..."
* Tweets with link to security culture hand book...
* Please post photos of police presence...
* Next day he was arrested, carrying a camera, police scanner, and a piece of paper I referred to earlier.
* Judge: Is the evidence of the paper in? I know it's an arrest hotline, but it may have been excluded... I don't remember it anywhere other than the detention application which was excluded.
* It's the agreed statement.
* Regarding the rockets, it is the Crown's position that it was just a cover for the chemicals...
* In his statement to Bui --
* Judge: the first?
* Yes -- ...
* Defense whispers to Crown.
* Crown: Excuse me, while I was away it seems errors in the transcript were fixed.
* The question that begs to be asked, is if you're going to build a rocket, are you going to start with the fuel? It has to fit inside the fuel. He'd need to.... He only learned about the licensing after 
* ...
* Judge: I see your point that it is convenient. But he's posting publicly about it, it seems strange if he's so worried that he's setting it up...
* The Crown's theory is that he got the idea from hacklab.
* ...
* Your honor has seen photos of the entire part of the house. There were no rockets, no cones for packing the fuel...
* Judge: I don't know that I saw the hold house.
* Fair enough. But there is no evidence that Mr. Sonne was in possession of rockets or other...
* Judge: But I believe the officer was asked and clarified that he was not looking for rocketry.
* Another officers..
* Anderson said that a lot of rocket fuels in the US use chlorate....
* There has been no evidence that it could be used to make rocket engines. No expert called.
* The only evidence of rocketry is from Mr. Supinski, he was intelligent and a friend of Mr. Sonne. He was defensive from the moment from the beginning. He was
 * We do know he was a founding member of hacklab, a group based on the principle of safety.
 * He was fascinated at rocket.
 * He wanted to build a complicated rocket.
 * He talked to anyone he could at the hacklab.
 * Because of budget constraints...
 * He was interested in the electronics but not the fuels... He knew about the 4 levels...
 * He knew you needed a license to design fuel.
 * He was clear he didn't know about making fuel.
 * ...
 * He admitted that he talked to Mr. Sonne about explosives and that Mr. Sonne was fascinated by them.
 * He didn't know what was found at Mr. Sonne's during the search. Didn't know about Ragner's guide...
 * What did come of importance was the chats from the hacklab chat room.
 * We know that Mr. Sonne is sensitive to the possibility of someone listening.
 * He repeatedly asked for the website of CAR, which is a simple google search even for me.
 * He tells everyone why he wanted to talk to Fredrick.
 * Judge: Is it your suggestion that it is part of a cover?
 * Of course! If he wanted the website, he would have checked it out earlier. And he could have googled. And given the relationship, he could have just picked up the phone.
 * Interesting to note that there is no chat about designing a rocket. Just designing an engine from Mr. Sonne and Mr. Supinski reminding him of the regulations.
 * Mr. Sonne repeats that he can't make the fuel. He is clear he has stopped.
 * But later that same chat, Mr. Sonne says he is looking for KCl_2 stop.
 * He says he is stopping after this run.
 * On may 17th, he contacts three different companies looking for KCl salt. Then he goes to Canadian Tire and buys water softener...
 * And yet on chat, he's looking for a 20 kilo bag on chat.
 * He's not stopping!
 * He stopped but he's buying more.
 * Judge: He buys water softener. .. the photo is water softener?
 * Yes.
 * Yet on the 29th he says he's looking for a 20 kilo bag.
 * Judge: Is there evidence that they are essentially the same thing, the potassium chloride and the water softener?
 * Judge: What evidence do I have that he's buying the same thing twice... What evidence do I have?
 * I don't think it's a huge jump that potassium chloride is in the water softener. Whether it needs to be refined...
 * Judge: I guess it makes sense that potassium chloride water softener contains potassium chloride...
 * And it is obviously for the electrolysis cell...
 * He says he's stopping, but not.
 * Judge: But he says all of this in the same chat?
 * He can't help himself, like in the statement...
 * ojacobson says: "if you're going to buy that much of an explosives precursor, all I'm saying."
 * They're talking about someone buying amonium nitrate
 * goatlab responds that it wasn't him, and only had one kilo.
 * Mr. Supinski says he was using it for a fertilizer.
 * Doesn't make sense. There's easier ways to get fertilizer. And strange...
 * Judge: Do I have any evidence of that?
 * I think you can...
 * Judge: I've seen evidence is seeds and ...
 * It doesn't make sense because of the quantity, the difficulty in getting it, the fact that he brought it up in a chat about explosives...
 * Judge: That came up because of an explosion?
 * Judge: Is there any evidence about its use as a fertilizer.
 * Dr. Andrson indicated that amonium nitrate was tough to find, regulated, and that a vendor had to do due diligence.
 * Judge: You're not suggesting that it can't be used as fertilizer, but that it has nefarious uses.
 * He got it from cold packs, extracted it, stored it in his lab.. And he hasn't put it in his garden as of...
 * Refers to it as "one hell of an Oklahoma special"
 * Further, we know that only in four days of chat, selected by the defense, Mr. Sonne talks about explosions of one sort or another nine times...
 * Discussions of explosives...
 * ...
 * Anderson talked about the cell. The water contained both chloride and chlorate.
 * In the chat, Mr. Sonne admits that he had these problems in the chat, confirming Dr. Anderon's evidence.
 * There was what, Dr. Anderson says, was a lid for a larger electrochemical cell.
 * The evidence seems to suggest it was the other way around.
 * May 18th, he posts a picture on Flickr, which is discussed as the electrolysis cell. But the police couldn't find it. The inference would be that, for some reason, it was removed.
* The most important evidence is that of Dr. Anderson. He is renound in his field. It was not challenged in cross.
 * He testified that TATP needed hydrogen peroxide, acetone...
 * Judge: Am I correct that the content of the acetone bottles were not checked for contents?
 * Well, yes, you have to find that they would have contained what they were labeled and weren't empty.
 * Judge: This is a criminal trial...
 * This was covered in one of the cases I gave you.
 * In the head note of HAYM. "Even though no chemical testing was done, the court accepted his testimony as to what the chemicals were based on..."
 * Judge: If this was nail polish remover and someone opened it, smelled it, and said it was nail polish remover and... but... This is whether or not it exists at all... If I draw that inference that could be an issue in another court. There's no evidence of a police officer looking to see if there was liquid in it...
 * There's no evidence the FBI was there... Your honor can infer...
 * Methyl hydrate... purification...
 * Judge: Just speaking generally. Consider acetone. It had a normal use. ... That was an essential component.
 * ...
 * Judge: Perhaps I should have taken chemistry in grade 13...
 * Judge: Perhaps you should draw on other evidence... Ragner's guide
 * That's what Dr. Anderson was so scary. The instructions are on the internet and they have common uses!
 * The chloride/chlorate was a bit of a distraction. It has nothing to do with the explosive count.
 * Judge: Doesn't the chlorate relate to ANFO?
 * As I understand it, it is Amonium Nitrate and a carbon source.
 * Oh, Mr. diLuca correctly points out that the ANFO potassium chlorate as an oxidizer.
 * (Judge starts asking questions about chemicals, Crown get's confused)
 * I'm going to have to defer these questions. Now would be a great time to take a break.
 * Judge: This whole case is circumstantial. There's a possible technical issue with a potential missing chemical...
 * I wouldn't have known that my acetone could make TATP, but Mr. Sonne clearly did.

**Break**

* Judge: Regarding charge 4..
* My understanding is that ANFO, when used in the mining industry, is amonium nitrate and petroleum oil. To detonate it, one uses termite. In this case, one can use the chlorate, which is why it was included in charge 4.
* Judge: Does Dr. Anderson talk about this?
* Yes. Page ... Regarding its use in rocket fuel...
* Judge: I know he talks about its use in fireworks and ...
* I don't have his testimony right now. It's a thermite. He says it burs fast. "It's can be used at a propellant. It burns fast, but not supersonic..." He saying it could set it off another explosive...
* Judge: Why is it in count 4?
* It's more sensitive to heat than ANFO...
* Judge: So what's the theory of the crown with regards to count 4?
* Potassium chlorate with regards to set up ANFO.
* It's part of the explosive process.
* Judge: So the real ingredient is amonium nitrate. And you don't need the chlorate to set it off?
* No. But it's the optimal way. That's my understanding.
* Judge: Let me put it this way: I think it is important I understand the role of potassium chlorate, and that presumably would come from the testimony of Dr. Anderson.
* I certainly accept your honors concerns with regards to charge 1 and the acetone. You can set off TATP easily with a light bulb.
* Judge: I think the acetone is probably a fatal flaw...
* Moving on to count 2, your honor. Both HDM and HTMD are sensitive to heat and can be set off really easily. That's why the chlorate isn't as relevant.
* The ingredients are hard to get. Dr. Anderson told a story about trying to get Hydrogen Peroxide...
* Judge: Hydrogen peroxide... Oh, no, I was thinking of something else for removing stains... Draino and Muriatic acid had...
* I think what is telling is that hexamine tablets are needed for both 2 and 3...
* Judge: I recall camping gear?
* The hexamine had been transferred itno plastic containers with their chemical names in it. All the tablets were out of their packaging and... There was some suggestion made that you could use it on the stove, but the stove was for gas and while Dr. Anderson said you could use it, it seems odd. There's so many, and why would you use that instead of gas? I suppose one might say it is easier to move... And why would you buy them in the spring? And they're labeled hexamine instead of fuel tablets, which would have been hard for his wife. It isn't reasonable to suggest they were solely for fuel.
* Dr. Anderson said that only one or two are needed to start a camp fire.
* Judge: Do I know the number? You suggested that the containers are large? ... I just have the number of grams...
* We've already reviewed the amonium nitrate. It was extracted from cold packs, quite a number of cold packs.
* ... nitric acid can be made...
* Potassium nitrate ...
* Judge: Just pause for a moment. Count 3, HDN, is ...?
* It's hexamine and nitric acid?
* Judge: Then what's the relevance of urea nitrate?
* ...
* Council passes crown note
* You're quite right your honor, hexamine dinitrate...
* Judge: I would like from you, for the morning, exactly what chemicals make each explosive, so I don't have to try and work it from Dr. Anderson's evidence.
* ...
* Urea can be used to make nitric acid.
* As I understand, HDN is made from nitric acide and hexamine. Nitric acid can be made from potassium nitrate and hydrochloric acid. The equipment necessary to do that was present. Later, Dr. Anderson indicated that Urea could also be used to make nitric acid as well as being a ferilizer, so it is very easy to turn into an explosive.
* Potassium permangonate was acquired after two failed attempts. It is not yet regulated, but is on the radar by his people after the underwear bomber. The Crown is asing you to note that Mr. Sonne tried to acquire them two weeks afterwards. This isn't a charge in the indictment, but is evidence... It's legal uses are pool cleaning and tanning.
* Judge: Do I know that there isn't a swimming pool?
* No... but there is no evidence that there was.
* Judge: The onus is on the Crown here.
* If you had a pool, would you keep it in your pool house, your garage or your lab? And would you go to *desperate* efforts to acquire it in the...
* Canning chemical... Doesn't make sense to have it in the kitchen. 
* Judge: is it an explosive?
* No, but can make nitric acid.
* Aluminimum powder. Dr. Andeson was aware of no household use.
* Iron oxide. This is thermite along with the aluminimum powder. It burns very hot.
* Zinc oxide. The only use Dr. Anderson knew of was in pyrotechnics. (aesthetic use?)
* ... fuel.
* Judge: Was the charcoal ever tested?
* I believe it was.
* From the Agreed Statement of Fact.
* Judge: It's not an essential ingredient, but I don't know that it was established that there was charcoal powder.
* Potassium chloride, we'll leave that till tomorrow.
* Sodium bicarbonate was also found. This is baking soda, and normal to have in a home, but it was in the lab, in a plastic jar, with its chemical symbol.
* Copper sulphate. It's a root remover.
* ... granular cool shock which was chlorine shock, indicated used in making the chlorate.
* Judge: Was that stored in the way one would store pool shock?
* I believe it was in its bag.
