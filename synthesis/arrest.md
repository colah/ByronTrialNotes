The Arrest of Byron Sonne
==========================

Byron came to the attention of the Police on June 15th as a"suspicious male" filming and taking pictures of the G20 security fence. A high-priority call was put out, and Byron was stopped by Constable Simon, who positioned Byron between the front of his car and himself, in the view of his vehicle's camera. Constable Simon was soon joined by Constables Coffin and Wong, who used their bikes to box in Byron. The officers questioned Byron, who refused to identify himself, asserting his right to not do so. In response, the Police threatened to arrest him for jay-walking (despite having, the officers have admitted, no grounds) and Byron identified himself.

Shortly there after, "open source research" (ie. googling) was conducted into Byron, in particular turning up his twitter stream, which the police found alarming. By the next day, Byron was under surveillance by a team of police officers. On 18th they observed that he went to "Tucker's Pottery Supply" and "Plastic World" but while this was considered very suspicious, police never went to the stores to find out what they sold. On the 21st, he bought gardening and barbecue supplies at the Home Depot. He spent the rest of the time around the house, some of it outdoors gardening or laying in a hammock.

Cumulatively, the observation and "open source research into the deep webs", raised sufficient concern for the police to seek a warrant to search Byron's house. The affidavit -- the document describing the reasons for the search which, when signed by a judge, becomes the warrant -- was written by one Officer French, an experienced and specially trained affiant. Since there is no defense attorney present when a warrant is signed, it is important that the affiant present both sides of the story, or, as they put it, be the 3 Fs: "Full, Fair, and Frank". 

It is surprising, then, that the affidavit it factually inaccurate, misleading, leaves out evidence in Byron's favor, lacks mention of several of its sources, and is occasionally ludicrous to anyone possessing basic scientific literacy. In fact, it failed to even reach the standards one expects of a middle school English assignment -- for example, putting quotes around content form Wikipedia, or otherwise signifying that it is not your own. On point in the affidavit that was of particular importance to French (he later described it as the "primary piece of evidence") and particularly disturbing for amateur science community, is Byron's microwave waveguide, which French claims "is used to send out sound waves that disrupts [sic] communication channels and can destroy them permanently" (in his testimony, it is revealed that French seems to believe that it could permanently destroy the radio waves). 

Given the misleading nature of the warrant, it is unsurprising that it was signed. 

Once the warrant was signed on June 22nd, authorizing them to search until 11:59pm, the police waited for Byron to leave his house, pulled over the bus he got on, and arrested him. Officer Penton, the arresting officer, did not give Byron his second caution. Apparently out of the concern that Byron might have someone interfere with the searches, an order was made to not allow Byron access to a telephone. It is not immediately clear why this continued for 12 hours, well after the premises of Byron's house was secured, or why when Byron's lawyers called and proved they were who they said, they were not allowed to speak to him.

Meanwhile, in violation of the Police's obligation to withhold questioning until the accused has received their right to counsel, Officers Hill and Garrow began interviewing Byron at approximately 4pm. They informed him that they were intelligence officers, not interested in the charges presently facing him and not there to gather evidence regarding him, but rather that they were responsible for managing confidential sources and were interested in information about planned violence at the G20. According to them, they went in knowing essentially nothing about Byron's charges and just had a conversation to introduce themselves and build rapport. Strangely enough, this interview, as with other early interviews, were not recorded and we have no way of knowing exactly what happened in them. However, there is other evidence in the form or references in later recorded interviews that suggests they interrogated Byron about pictures he posted on the Internet, and possibly other topics. In any event, once they left Byron they shared the information they had learned with the other officers present, arguably in breach of confidential informant privilege.

Contemporaneously with these interviews, the search warrant was being executed for Byron's house. At some point they found a chemistry lab and had the reaction one might expect. Officer's Hill and Garrow were informed and returned to interview Byron further. The explained to him that this was a matter of officer safety and that he needed to explain what everything was so that no one would be injured in conducting the search. Naturally, Byron answered. Somehow this also resulted in him talking about things that could potentially injure an officer at his cottage, which resulted in him talking about his potato cannon.

Back at Byron's house, the investigating officers came the belief that they had found the explosive HTMD (in fact, the lab only contained chemicals that could potentially be used to make explosives...) and mistook a thermocouple for a detonator. They also found the waveguide they were looking for... disassembled and in a box.

Using the results of Byron's interviews and the mistaken findings at Byron's house, French wrote a new affidavit. Somehow French didn't find out that the "wavegun" (the waveguide) was disassembled. Again, the affidavit was, unsurprisingly, signed.

After finally getting in contact with counsel by phone and declining to make a statement to the police when asked, Byron was given the opportunity to get some rest. Unfortunately a metal bed and the stress of detention aren't the most relaxing environment.

By morning, 24 hours of detention was rapidly approaching. This is significant because, in Canada, detention must be reviewed by a Justice of the Peace or Judge within 24 hours. However, the police decided to have Detective Bui interrogate Byron instead. As such, Byron's detention became unlawful. During the interview, several unpleasant if legal tactics were used to try and get a confession from Byron, in particular lying about what they'd found and what Byron had previously said. Part way through the interview, an officer reported that Byron's lawyers are there and want to speak to him, but Bui instructed him to inform them that Byron was not available.

Later, Byron's detention was reviewed and his detention became lawful again.
